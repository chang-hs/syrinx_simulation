<p>The pathophysiology of syringomyelia is still poorly understood. Many
hypotheses exist in the literature<span class="citation"

but they provide widely different explanations on the mechanisms of
syrinx generation. There are, however, a few consensuses. First, the
syrinx fluid is identical to the CSF, and there is some communication
between the syrinx and the subarachnoid space. This point is supported
by many studies<span class="citation"
data-cites="ellertsson1969syringomyelia ellertsson1969myelocystographic li1987conventional heiss2019origin"><sup>14–17</sup></span>.
Second, derangement of CSF flow in the spinal subarachnoid space is the
main cause of syrinx generation both in Chiari-I malformation<span
class="citation"

and subarachnoid arachnopathy<span class="citation"
data-cites="klekamp1997treatment brodbelt2003altered heiss2012pathophysiology chang2014dorsal"><sup>22–25</sup></span>.
Notably, the cerebellar tonsil deranges the CSF flow in the former and
adhesive arachnoiditis in the latter.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is where this communicating channel resides and
what is the exact mechanism of syrinx generation. On these points, there
is no solid experimental or clinical evidence, and the opinions of
researchers vary widely. Gardner et al.<span class="citation"
data-cites="gardner1958mechanism"><sup>1</sup></span> thought that the
central canal intercommunicates the syrinx and the fourth ventricle, and
pulsatile CSF pressure waves exerted on it generates the syrinx.
Williams et al. also postulated the communication through the central
canal, but he emphasized the craniospinal pressure gradient produced by
Valsalva maneuver et al.<span class="citation"
data-cites="williams1980pathogenesis"><sup>2</sup></span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ball and Dayan<span class="citation"
data-cites="ball1972pathogenesis"><sup>4</sup></span> assumed that CSF
entered the syrinx through the perivascular space of arteries
penetrating the spinal cord. This idea has the following variations.
Heiss et al.<span class="citation"
data-cites="heiss1999elucidating"><sup>7</sup></span> proposed that the
piston-like movement of the cerebellar tonsils in Chiari-I patients
generated pressure waves in the spinal subarachnoid space. And it
subsequently drove CSF into the syrinx through the perivascular space.
Stoodley et al. also considered the perivascular space as the
communicating channel, but he assumed the arterial pulse pressure as the
driving force<span class="citation"
data-cites="stoodley2000mechanisms"><sup>26</sup></span>. All these
assumptions are not proven and remain hypothetical. Although recent
researchers seem to favor the perivascular-space theory, there remains
the possibility that a thin communicating channel exists between the
syrinx and the fourth ventricle<span class="citation"
data-cites="chang2021hypothesis"><sup>27</sup></span>.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the main theoretical problems reside in the following
points.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>No theory can explain the pathophysiological mechanism of
syringomyelia in a unified fashion.</p></li>
<li><p>No theory can explain how CSF enters from the low-pressure
subarachnoid space to the high-pressure syrinx cavity and remains
inside.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are different types of syringomyelia such as
Chiari-I-malformation and spinal-arachnopathy-related<span
class="citation" data-cites="klekamp1997treatment"><sup>22</sup></span>.
Also, the Chiari-I-malformation-related syringomyelia is further
subdivided into communicating and non-communicating<span
class="citation"
data-cites="elliott2013syringomyelia"><sup>28</sup></span>. Despite the
differences in etiology and imaging findings, the final phenomenon of
syrinx formation is common among them. Therefore, we are tended to
assume a common underlying mechanism in these different types of
syringomyelia<span class="citation"
data-cites="stoodley2000mechanisms"><sup>26</sup></span>. In fact, it is
counter-intuitive to assume completely different mechanisms to these
very similar pheomena, e.g. perivascular communication for
non-communicating syringomyelia, and central-canal communication for
communicating syringomyelia.</p>
<p>The second point is theoretically essential but challenging to solve.
Physical laws dictate that the expanded syrinx cavity has higher
pressure than the adjacent subarachnoid space<span class="citation"
data-cites="serwayr.a.2016fluids heiss1999elucidating davis1989mechanisms ellertsson1970distending"><sup>7,29–31</sup></span>.
We can intuitively understand it by the fact that the inside pressure
must additionally confront the elastic tension of the syrinx wall.
Therefore, merely assuming a communicating channel does not explain how
CSF enters and remains inside the syrinx against this pressure gradient.
Even if we take a specific time window where the subarachnoid pressure
exceeds the syrinx pressure, it does not explain how the CSF remains
inside the syrinx after it. We will call this problem the
pressure-gradient paradox in this article.</p>
<p>The current article is part of our effort to solve the above
theoretical problems. We proposed in our previous paper<span
class="citation" data-cites="chang2021hypothesis"><sup>27</sup></span> a
hypothesis on the pathophysiology of syringomyelia as follows. Suppose,
at a certain location in the spinal subarachnoid space, there exists a
direction-selective resistance to CSF flow. For example, we can assume a
resistance selectively resisting to the caudal flow and less resisting
to the rostral flow. To-and-fro CSF movement across this resistance
certainly affects the pressure inside the spinal cord matrix. We
hypothesized that this repetitive pressure alteration inside the cord is
related to the mechanism of syrinx generation. We would like to describe
the detail of this theory in this article, which we could not elaborate
in the previous article.</p>
<p>This hypothesis was attractive to us because it seemed to solve the
two theoretical problems listed above. First, it could explain the two
types of syringomyelia (Chiari-related and arachnopathy-related) in a
unifying fashion. Namely, we could assume the tonsil and the adhesive
arachnoid membrane both working as a direction-selective resistance.
Second, this theory could solve the pressure-gradient paradox as will be
seen below.</p>
<p>The analysis was carried out using our electric-circuit model of the
spinal CSF dynamics, which we publised in our previous articles<span
class="citation"
data-cites="chang2003hypothesis chang2004theoretical"><sup>11,12</sup></span>
and revised for the current purpose.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="material-and-method">Material and Method</h1>
<p>Our intention in this study was to make a basic model that could
clarify the phenomenon underlying the syrinx generation and not to make
a quantitatively precise model of the spinal CSF flow. There is a
problem when we try to simulate the motion of biological fluids such as
blood and CSF. Such bodily fluids move inside flexible tubes. It differs
from the usual situation of fluid mechanics, where the boundary of the
fluid conduit is solid. Thus, we cannot simply apply the standard
Navier-Stokes equations for our simulation. For this reason, researchers
have commonly used lumped parameter models<span class="citation"
data-cites="shi2011review kokalari2013review"><sup>32,33</sup></span>.
This model interprets the fluid flow inside a flexible tube analogous to
the electric flow in an electric circuit. The accumulation of
electricity in a capacitor represents the expansion of a flexible tube
and the accompanying pressure elevation. An electrical resistor
represents the frictional resistance to flow. Our current model is the
type of lumped parameter model with multiple compartments<span
class="citation"
data-cites="shi2011review kokalari2013review"><sup>32,33</sup></span>
that simulates the CSF dynamics in the spine and is an updated version
of the model used in our previous articles<span class="citation"

<p>Figure 1 shows the scheme of our spinal CSF dynamics model. It
included two CSF pathways along the spinal cord. One was the spinal
subarachnoid space represented by the resistors designated with
<em>R</em>. The other was an intraspinal pathway represented with
resistors designated with <em>r</em>. This intraspinal pathway was
envisaeged as the central canal, but could be any other CSF pathway
postulated to be in the spinal cord. The rational for incorporating the
central canal in the theory is thoroughly explained in our previous
article<span class="citation"

<p>Figure 2 shows the bare electric circuit extracted from Figure 1. A
set of differential equations could describe the behavior of this model.
Using computer software, we could numerically calculate its behavior in
response to a certain cranial pressure wave (defined as a boundary
condition on the cranial nodes). In our previous articles<span
class="citation"
data-cites="chang2003hypothesis chang2004theoretical"><sup>11,12</sup></span>,
we only analyzed the transient behavior of the model to a sudden
pressure increase on the cranial side of the subarachnoid space. This
analysis helped simulate the situation of coughing or Valsalva
maneuvers. In this article, however, we analyzed the response of the
model to an oscillating cranial pressure wave simulating the normal
to-and-fro movement of the CSF.</p>

<p>We described the differential equations on a computer software
(Mathematica version 12, Wolfram Research, Champaign, IL, U.S.A.) and
solved them numerically. We set the boundary conditions as follows. (1)
The voltage at the two cranial nodes was set to a sine wave oscillating
around 10 <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em><em>m</em><em>H</em><sub>2</sub><em>O</em></span>
with an amplitude of 20 <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em><em>m</em><em>H</em><sub>2</sub><em>O</em></span>
at one cycle per second. (2) The initial dural pressure was set at 10
<span
class="math inline"><em>c</em><em>m</em><em>H</em><sub>2</sub><em>O</em></span>
in all segments. We set the step of the numerical solution to 1/5000
second and calculated the solution from zero to 20 seconds. The actual
Mathematica codes can be found in our GitHub repository (<a
href="https://github.com/chang-hs/syrinx_simulation.git"
class="uri">https://github.com/chang-hs/syrinx_simulation.git</a>).</p>
<p>We analyzed three different settings of the system. The first setting
was the original normal system simulating the normal status. In the
second setting, we simply increased the subarachnoid resistance at point
25 (<span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub>25</sub></span>) by 20
times. In the third setting, we placed a direction-selective
subarachnoid resistance at point 25, so that only the resistance to the
caudal flow would be increased by 20 times.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="results">Results</h1>
<p>We present the systems’ responses in animation. The x-axis of each
animation represents the 100 nodes of the circuit laid out from the
cranial to caudal direction. The y-axis displays a certain subset of the
following four parameters: the dural tension (voltage in D capacitors in
Figure 1, 2), the canal tension (voltages in C capacitors in Figure 1,
2), the subarachnoid CSF flow (flows in R resistors in Figure 1, 2), and
the channel flow (flows in r resistors in Figure 1, 2). We plotted the
caudal flow in the positive and the rostral flow in the negative
direction. The pressure values are shown in <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em><em>m</em><em>H</em><sub>2</sub><em>O</em></span>,
the flows in <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em><em>l</em>/<em>s</em><em>e</em><em>c</em></span>.
To plot the four parameters in a single animation, we multiplied the
values of the following three parameters by certain coefficients.
Namely, the canal tension was multiplied by 50, the subarachnoid flow by
0.005, and the canal flow by <span
class="math inline">1.5 × 10<sup>5</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Video 1 shows the original system’s response representing the normal
condition. In this state, the dural tension made a smooth gradient along
the spine, whose polarity alternated according to the pressure cycle.
CSF made smooth to-and-fro movements in the subarachnoid space with the
corresponding pressure wave along the dura and the central canal. CSF
also made smooth to-and-fro movements in the intraspinal channel.
Pressure elevation in the wall of the intra-spinal channel was
minimal.</p>
<p>[movie] : totalAnimationNorm.mp4</p>
<p>In Video 2, we increased the subarachnoid resistance <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub>25</sub></span> by 20 times, thereby
simulating a simple block of the subarachnoid flow in both directions.
In this condition, both the caudal and rostral flow across the
resistance produced pressure drop in the distal subarachnoid segment.
This pressure drop caused an increase in canal flow in the same
direction as the subarachnoid flow. This increased canal flow caused a
transient increase in the canal pressure distal to the block and a
decrease proximal to the block. However, these pressure changes
alternated along the alternation of the flow direction and did not
produce a sustained pressure increase.</p>
<p>In Video 3, we replaced the subarachnoid resistor <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub>25</sub></span> with a
direction-selective resistor whose resistance to the rostral flow was
unchanged but that to the caudal flow was increased by 20 times. This
time, sustained high pressure appeared in the intra-spinal channel in
the segment distal to the replaced resistor, and sustained low pressure
in the segment proximal to it. This sustained pressure gradually
accumulated as the flow cycle proceeded. The dural tension showed a
pressure drop at node 25 only during the caudal-flow phase. The
to-and-fro canal flow increased near the node 25 similarly to that in
the simple block above, but, this time, the increase was larger in the
caudal direction.</p>
<p>We extracted the canal flow from this animation and showed it in
Video 4. Observing this video, we can see that the cumulative total of
the caudal flow is larger than that of the rostral flow, meaning that
the CSF is virtually pumped caudally at node 25. To further elucidate
this point, Video 4 simultaneously shows the canal flow in the simple
block as shown in Video <a href="#video:simple_block"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="video:simple_block">[video:simple_block]</a> and that in
the one-way block as shown in Video <a href="#video:oneway"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="video:oneway">[video:oneway]</a>. We can clearly see
that the caudal flow is about the same in the two models, while the
rostral flow is smaller in the direction-selective model. It means that
CSF in the intra-spinal channel is pumped caudally in each cycle of the
to-and-fro CSF movement.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>In this article, we theoretically analyzed the CSF movement in the
spine using a lumped parameter model with multiple compartments. It
simulated a system with an elastic tube (dura) containing an elastic
cylindrical material (spinal cord) that itself had a fluid channel
inside. When we placed a direction-selective resistor in the
subarachnoid space and evoked a to-and-fro pressure wave on this system,
it produced a sustained pressure elevation in the segment distal to the
resistor in the resisted direction. This phenomenon may explain the
pathogenesis of syringomyelia both in Chiari I malformation and
syringomyelia associated with arachnopathy.</p>
<p>Subarachnoid pressure pushes the spinal cord material and affects the
pressure inside the intra-spinal channel. As seen in Figure <a
href="#fig:circuit" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:circuit">2</a>, the absolute pressure inside the
intra-spinal channel is the sum of the subarachnoid and channel tension
(voltages of <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></span> in electrical
terms). Suppose a one-way valve selectively resists caudal flow in the
subarachnoid space at point <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>.
Caudal CSF flow creates a pressure drop across point <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, with the caudal pressure smaller
than the proximal one. Thus, the absolute pressure in the canal distal
to point <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> become smaller
because the outside subarachnoid pressure there is smaller. It,
therefore, creates a pressure gradient in the central canal across point
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, thereby increasing the
distal CSF flow in the canal at that point (Figure <a
href="#fig:pump_close" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:pump_close">3</a>).</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 3: Increased central-canal flow
across a direction-selective resistance in the subarachnoid

</figure>
<p>On the contrary, rostral flow, not encountering resistance, does not
create a pressure drop (Figure <a href="#fig:pump_open"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:pump_open">4</a>).
Although some of the CSF that had been pumped caudally during the
caudal-flow phase will flow back rostrally, its amount will be smaller.
The net result will be that some CSF is pumped caudally in one cycle of
the to-and-fro movement. Thus, CSF gradually accumulates in the distal
segment of the resistance (Video 3). We hypothesize that this is the
mechanism underlying the syrinx generation.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 4: Normal central-canal flow

</figure>
<p>Our theory clearly explained how the CSF is paradoxically driven into
the high-pressure syrinx and retained inside against the pressure
gradient. In the direction-selective resistance model, the caudal
segment of the intra-spinal channel has sustained higher pressure than
the subarachnoid space. However, the energy of to-and-fro CSF movement
creates alternating pressure gradient in the rostro-caudal direction.
Because this rostro-caudal pressure gradient is larger than the
sustained high pressure of the intra-spinal channel, CSF flows into the
caudal segment from the rostral side during the caudal flow phase
(Figurefig. 3). In the rostral flow phase, the rostro-caudal pressure
gradient is reversed in direction; the pressure on the rostral side
becomes smaller than that on the caudal side. CSF flows out rostrally
from the caudal intra-spinal channel; however, because the pressure-drop
effect caused by the subarachnoid resistance is absent in this phase,
the rostro-caudal pressure gradient in the intra-spinal channel is
smaller and the rostral CSF flow is smaller than that during the caudal
flow phase (Figurefig. 4). We believe that this is the mechanism of the
apparently paradoxical behavior of the CSF in syringomyelia.</p>
<p>Direction-selective resistance to CSF flow is not an imaginative
assumption. In Chiari-I malformation, the herniated tonsils move like a
ball-valve; they are displaced caudally during the caudal flow and
rostrally during the rostral flow. The higher velocity observed in the
phase-contrast MRI studies suggests that they selectively impede the
caudal CSF flow more than the cranial flow. Williams et al. demonstrated
direction-selective resistance at the craniovertebral junction of
Chiari-I patients, which became the basis of his theory<span
class="citation"
data-cites="williams1981simultaneous"><sup>37</sup></span>. Also, some
types of arachnoid pathology may function as one-way valves. In 2014, we
reported cases of thoracic arachnoid web associated with syringomyelia,
in which phase-contrast MRI demonstrated one-way-valve-like behavior of
the arachnoid web<span class="citation"
data-cites="chang2014dorsal"><sup>25</sup></span>. In surgery, we found
an obliquely oriented arachnoid web that resembled a one-way valve.
Thus, our hypothesis may also solve the second theoretical problem we
pointed out in the Introduction. Namely, the direction-selective
resistance in spinal subarachnoid space may function as the common
mechanism underlying both Chiari-I-related and arachnopathy-related
syringomyelia.</p>
<p>transformed into the energy-requiring trasport of CSF into the
syrinx. However, previous theories seemed to have difficulty in
explaining this process. According to the theories of Heiss et al.<span
class="citation" data-cites="heiss1999elucidating"><sup>7</sup></span>
or that of Stoodley et al.<span class="citation"
data-cites="stoodley2000mechanisms"><sup>26</sup></span>, the energy is
provided by either enhanced pressure waves in subarachnoid space or
pulsation of spinal arteries. However, none of these theories explains
the detailed mechanism</p>
<p>Our results may cast some light on another interesting question. In
cervical spondylosis, subarachnoid space is similarly obliterated by the
protruding discs and osteophytes. Although this is a widely prevaent
disease, we rarely encounter syringomyelia associated with cervical
spondylosis. In our results, a simple block of the subarachnoid CSF flow
did not produce sustained elevation of intraspinal channel pressure
(Video 2). This result may explain why syringomyelia is rarely
associated with cervical spondylosis.</p>
<p>There are some controversial points in our theory. Our model presumed
the existence of a CSF channel inside the spinal cord. It may be
controversial because most syringes seem to lack such communication.
Yet, there still may exist a narrow CSF channel that is undetectable on
MRI. In fact, ordinary MRI does not visualize the central canal with a
diameter of 100 micrometers. Therefore, assuming the existence of a CSF
channel inside the cord will not be far-fetched. Another point of
controversy will be the role of the central canal. The human central
canal is obstructed with advancing age, and assuming a function of the
central canal may not befit that fact. However, the obliteration of the
central canal seem to be a slow process, and it could be mostly patent
up to the fourth decade<span class="citation"
data-cites="newman1981observations yasui1999agerelated"><sup>38,39</sup></span>.
Moreover, the CSF channel does not have to be the central canal but some
other channel created inside the spinal cord matrix.</p>
