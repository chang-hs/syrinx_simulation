  abstract = {When a person (traditionally the wife in many cultures) assumes the family name of his or her spouse, that name replaces the person's birth name, which in the case of the wife is called the maiden name. "Birth name" is also used as a gender-neutral or masculine substitute for "maiden name." A married name is a family name or surname adopted by a person upon marriage. In some jurisdictions, changing one's name requires a legal procedure. Nevertheless, in some jurisdictions, anyone who either marries or divorces may change his or her name. Due to increasing security and identification needs, even where it is legal, the common law method is rarely accepted any more except at marriage (especially for women). Traditionally, in the Anglophone West, only women do so, but in rare instances men may change their last names upon marriage as well. In the United States, only eight states have an official name change for a man as part of their marriage process; others may petition a court, or, where not prohibited, use the common law method (though government agencies sometimes do not recognize this procedure for men). Due to the widespread practice of women changing their names at marriage, they encounter little difficulty using the common law method at marriage in those jurisdictions that permit it.},

The far lateral approach is a well-established technique for the removal of pathology ventrolateral to the brainstem and the craniocervical junction, but it may be too extensive for lesions limited to areas far from the midline. OBJECTIVE: To present an alternative to the commonly used approaches to the foramen magnum and upper cervical. METHODS: We used an approach directly overlying ventral or lateral pathology. RESULTS: Two cases are presented in which the direct lateral approach followed by an occipitocervical fusion was successfully performed. CONCLUSION: This approach can be considered for patients in whom a ventral decompression is necessary but an endoscopic endonasal approach is undesirable or when a ventral, lateral, and ventrolateral resection of tumor, pannus, or infection is required.},

The authors report a unique case of leptomeningeal dissemination of a spinal cord pilocytic astrocytoma (PCA) to the intracranial cerebral subarachnoid spaces in a child. A 2-year-old boy presented with a loss of balance and the inability to walk or stand. An intradural intramedullary spinal cord tumor was identified, and the lesion was subtotally resected and diagnosed by the pathology department to be a PCA. Subsequently, the patient had recurrences of the intradural intramedullary tumor at 6 months and 2 years after his original presentation. He underwent a repeated resection of the recurrent tumor and fenestration of an associated syrinx on both occasions. The pathological characteristics of the reresected tumor remained consistent with those of a PCA. Postoperative imaging after his last surgery revealed diffuse intracranial leptomeningeal dissemination into the cisternal space surrounding the midbrain, the suprasellar region, and the internal auditory canal, as well as nodular subarachnoid disease in the upper cervical region. The patient then underwent chemotherapy, and total spine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging 2 months later demonstrated stability in the size of the spinal cord tumor and a decrease in the associated syrinx. However, an MR image of the head demonstrated two new areas of supratentorial subarachnoid leptomeningeal spread of the primary spinal cord tumor at the 2-month follow-up examination. At the 6-month follow-up examination, MR imaging of the head and spine demonstrated stable metastatic disease. This case illustrates a unique instance of supratentorial leptomeningeal dissemination of an intramedullary spinal cord PCA in a child.},

Here, we describe an intradural extramedullary thoracic HPC that went undiagnosed initially on computed tomography scan of the abdomen. PURPOSE: To describe the clinical presentation and operative management of a patient diagnosed with an intradural extramedullary thoracic HPC that was missed on initial workup. We also describe the pathologic features of HPC. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. METHODS: Chart review and literature search. CASE: A 58-year-old man presented with acute weakness of the lower extremities and bladder and bowel incontinence. Magnetic resonance imaging of his spine revealed a T10 intradural extramedullary lesion that displaced the cord to the right. RESULTS: The patient was taken emergently to surgery for T9-T11 laminectomy and en bloc resection of the tumor. The lesion was identified and resected. Histology revealed randomly oriented tumor cells with irregular capillaries consistent with HPC. Postoperatively, the patient had an improved neurological examination, and he continued to do so with intense physical therapy. CONCLUSION: The standard treatment for HPC is surgery when the lesion is resectable. Despite gross total resection, there is still a high risk of recurrence and metastasis; therefore, patients should be followed up closely by their physicians with serial postoperative clinical examinations and radiographic imaging.},

  abstract = {Adult scoliosis is defined as a spinal deformity in a skeletally mature patient with a Cobb angle of more than 10 degrees in the coronal plain. Adult scoliosis can be separated into four major groups: Type 1: Primary degenerative scoliosis, mostly on the basis of a disc and/or facet joint arthritis, affecting those structures asymmetrically with predominantly back pain symptoms, often accompanied either by signs of spinal stenosis (central as well as lateral stenosis) or without. These curves are often classified as "de novo" scoliosis. Type 2: Idiopathic adolescent scoliosis of the thoracic and/or lumbar spine which progresses in adult life and is usually combined with secondary degeneration and/or imbalance. Some patients had either no surgical treatment or a surgical correction and fusion in adolescence in either the thoracic or thoracolumbar spine. Those patients may develop secondary degeneration and progression of the adjacent curve; in this case those curves belong to the type 3a. Type 3: Secondary adult curves: (a) In the context of an oblique pelvis, for instance, due to a leg length discrepancy or hip pathology or as a secondary curve in idiopathic, neuromuscular and congenital scoliosis, or asymmetrical anomalies at the lumbosacral junction; (b) In the context of a metabolic bone disease (mostly osteoporosis) combined with asymmetric arthritic disease and/or vertebral fractures. Sometimes it is difficult to decide, what exactly the primary cause of the curve was, once it has significantly progressed. However, once an asymmetric load or degeneration occurs, the pathomorphology and pathomechanism in adult scoliosis predominantly located in the lumbar or thoracolumbar spine is quite predictable. Asymmetric degeneration leads to increased asymmetric load and therefore to a progression of the degeneration and deformity, as either scoliosis and/or kyphosis. The progression of a curve is further supported by osteoporosis, particularly in post-menopausal female patients. The destruction of facet joints, joint capsules, discs and ligaments may create mono- or multisegmental instability and finally spinal stenosis. These patients present themselves predominantly with back pain, then leg pain and claudication symptoms, rarely with neurological deficit, and almost never with questions related to cosmetics. The diagnostic evaluation includes static and dynamic imaging, myelo-CT, as well as invasive diagnostic procedures like discograms, facet blocks, epidural and root blocks and immobilization tests. These tests may correlate with the clinical and the pathomorphological findings and may also offer the least invasive and most rational treatment for the patient. The treatment is then tailored to the specific symptomatology of the patient. Surgical management consists of either decompression, correction, stabilization and fusion procedures or a combination of all of these. Surgical procedure is usually complex and has to deal with a whole array of specific problems like the age and the general medical condition of the patient, the length of the fusion, the condition of the adjacent segments, the condition of the lumbosacral junction, osteoporosis and possibly previous scoliosis surgery, and last but not least, usually with a long history of chronified back pain and muscle imbalance which may be very difficult to be influenced. Although this surgery is demanding, the morbidity cannot be considered significantly higher than in other established orthopaedic procedures, like hip replacement, in the same age group of patients. Overall, a satisfactory outcome can be expected in well-differentiated indications and properly tailored surgical procedures, although until today prospective, controlled studies with outcome measures and pre- and post-operative patient's health status are lacking. As patients, who present themselves with significant clinical problems in the context of adult scoliosis, get older, minimal invasive procedures to address exactly the most relevant clinical problem may become more and more important, basically ignoring the overall deformity and degeneration of the spine.},

METHODS: The updated guidelines were produced via a DELPHI consensus exercise. Members from the previous DELPHI group were again invited, alongside editorial board members and peer reviewers of the International Journal of Surgery and the International Journal of Surgery Case Reports. An online survey was completed by this expert group to indicate their agreement with proposed changes to the checklist items. RESULTS: A total of 53 surgical experts agreed to participate and 49 (92\%) completed the survey. The responses and suggested modifications were incorporated into the previous 2018 guidelines. There was a high degree of agreement amongst the PROCESS Group, with all but one of the PROCESS items receiving over 70\% of scores ranging 7-9.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evaluation of the intracranial venous system has historically been performed with conventional catheter-based digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The continued importance of DSA can not be overstated in light of its inherent option of endovascular intervention and thrombolysis for cerebral venous thrombosis. DSA is, however, an invasive procedure with associated risks, including radiation exposure, and adverse effects of iodinated contrast medium. DSA also suffers from the limitations of 2-dimensional planar imaging. For these reasons, noninvasive imaging techniques are playing a greater role in evaluation of the intracranial venous system. REVIEW SUMMARY: This review provides an overview of the current noninvasive methods and their applications and limitations, with examples of their use in a variety of disease processes. Computed tomography venography (CTV) is discussed as well as the various types of cerebral magnetic resonance venography (MRV). CONCLUSION: When available, MR supplemented with the technique of triggered gadolinium-enhanced MRV is the method of choice for the diagnosis of dural sinus thrombosis as well as most other pathologic entities affecting the intracranial venous system.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transverse sinus stenosis is common in patients with IIH. While the role of transverse sinus stenosis in IIH pathogenesis remains controversial, modeling studies suggest that stent placement within a transverse sinus stenosis with a significant pressure gradient should decrease cerebral venous pressure, improve CSF resorption in the venous system, and thereby reduce intracranial (CSF) pressure, improving the symptoms of IIH and reducing papilledema. We aimed to determine if IIH could be reliably treated by stent placement in transverse sinus stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the clinical, venographic, and intracranial pressure data before and after stent placement in transverse sinus stenosis in 52 of our own patients with IIH unresponsive to maximum acceptable medical treatment, treated since 2001 and followed between 2 months and 9 years. RESULTS: Before stent placement, the mean superior sagittal sinus pressure was 34 mm Hg (462 mm H(2)0) with a mean transverse sinus stenosis gradient of 20 mm Hg. The mean lumbar CSF pressure before stent placement was 322 mm H(2)O. In all 52 patients, stent placement immediately eliminated the TSS pressure gradient, rapidly improved IIH symptoms, and abolished papilledema. In 6 patients, symptom relapse (headache) was associated with increased venous pressure and recurrent stenosis adjacent to the previous stent. In these cases, placement of another stent again removed the transverse sinus stenosis pressure gradient and improved symptoms. Of the 52 patients, 49 have been cured of all IIH symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a role for transverse sinus stent placement in the management of selected patients with IIH.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Fenestration is the gold standard surgery for lumbar spinal canal stenosis in Japan. Several previous studies have analyzed the reoperation rates in large numbers of patients undergoing several surgical procedures such as laminectomy with or without instrumented spinal fusion; however, there have been few studies focusing solely on fenestration. The purpose of this study was to calculate the reoperation rates after fenestration using the survival function method. METHODS: Form 1988-2007, 6,998 surgeries for lumbar spinal canal stenosis occurred in Miyagi prefecture, Japan, and these patients were enrolled by the spinal surgery registration system of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Tohoku University. Among these, 5,835 surgeries involved fenestration as a primary surgery and for those who underwent {$\geq$}2 lumbar surgeries we analyzed the reoperation rates using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Among the 5,835 patients undergoing primary fenestration, 215 patients underwent 221 revisions; 112 included the same spinal levels and 103 were revised only at other levels as primary fenestration. The overall reoperation rates were 0.8\% at 1 year, 2.9\% at 5 years, 5.2\% at 10 years, 7.5\% at 15 years and 8.6\% at {$>$}17.7 years. Reoperation rates for those at the same spinal levels were 0.6\% at 1 year, 1.7\% at 5 years, 2.7\% at 10 years, 3.8\% at 15 years, and 4.1\% at {$>$}17.0 years. CONCLUSIONS: Fenestration can be performed at low cost using standard spinal surgery equipments. The reoperation rates of this procedure were lower than previously reported for several other surgical procedures.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The pathophysiology of syringomyelia in Chiari type 1 malformations has not been clarified. Oedema-like spinal-cord swelling was recently reported in several pathological conditions, including Chiari type 1 malformations as a pre-syrinx state. However, the role of the pre-syrinx state in the development of syringomyelia is unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the parenchymal changes of the spinal cord in syringomyelia associated with Chiari type 1 malformations. METHODS: Pre- and postoperative MRI findings in 14 patients who underwent foramen magnum decompression in our institute were reviewed. The analysis was focused on differences in visualisation of the syrinx between T1- and T2-weighted images and abnormal parenchymal signal changes. There were 6 men and 8 women, aged from 6 to 79 years. No patients showed hydrocephalus. RESULTS: Twelve patients had large and expansive syrinx, whereas 2 patients showed small syrinx confined to the centre of the spinal cord. T2-weighted images displayed significantly larger intramedullary abnormal signal areas. Nine patients showed parenchymal hyperintensity areas around the enlarged central canal or base of the posterior white columns adjacent to the syringomyelic cavity. Such parenchymal hyperintensity areas markedly diminished with reduction of the syrinx after surgery and were considered to be interstitial oedema. CONCLUSIONS: From this study, the interstitial oedema of the spinal cord commonly accompanies syringomyelia with Chiari type 1 malformations. Accumulation of the extracellular fluid due to disturbed absorption mechanisms may play an important role in the pathophysiology of syringomyelia associated with Chiari type 1 malformations.},

Few previous ex vivo attempts have been made to characterize spinal cord elasticity (SCE). Recently, tissue elasticity assessment has been clinically feasible using ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE). The current study aims to characterize SCE in healthy dogs, in vivo, utilizing SWE, and to address SCE changes during compression. METHODS Ten Greyhound dogs (mean age 14 months; mean weight 14.3 kg) were anesthetized and tracheally intubated, with hemodynamic and neurological monitoring. A 3-level, midcervical laminectomy was performed. SCE was assessed at baseline. Next, 8- and 13-mm balloon compressions were sequentially applied ventral to the spinal cord. RESULTS The mean SCE was 18.5 {$\pm$} 7 kPa. Elasticity of the central canal, pia mater, and dura mater were 21.7 {$\pm$} 9.6 kPa, 26.1 {$\pm$} 14.8 kPa, and 63.2 {$\pm$} 11.5 kPa, respectively. As expected, the spinal cord demonstrated less elasticity than the dura mater (p {$<$} 0.0001) and pia mater (trend toward significance p = 0.08). Notably, the 13-mm balloon compression resulted in a stiffer spinal cord than at baseline (233 {$\pm$} 73 kPa versus 18.5 {$\pm$} 7 kPa, p {$<$} 0.0001) and 8-mm balloon compression (233 {$\pm$} 73 kPa versus 185 {$\pm$} 68 kPa, p {$<$} 0.048). CONCLUSIONS In vivo SCE evaluation using SWE is feasible and comparable to earlier reports, as demonstrated by physical sectioning of the spinal cord. The compressed spinal cord is stiffer than a free spinal cord, with a linear increase in SCE with increasing mechanical compression. Knowledge of the biomechanical properties of the spinal cord including SCE has potential implications for disease management and prognosis.},

  abstract = {Tracers injected into CSF pass into the brain alongside arteries and out again. This has been recently termed the "glymphatic system" that proposes tracers enter the brain along periarterial "spaces" and leave the brain along the walls of veins. The object of the present study is to test the hypothesis that: (1) tracers from the CSF enter the cerebral cortex along pial-glial basement membranes as there are no perivascular "spaces" around cortical arteries, (2) tracers leave the brain along smooth muscle cell basement membranes that form the Intramural Peri-Arterial Drainage (IPAD) pathways for the elimination of interstitial fluid and solutes from the brain. 2 {$\mu$}L of 100~{$\mu$}M soluble, fluorescent fixable amyloid {$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}) were injected into the CSF of the cisterna magna of 6-10 and 24-30~month-old male mice and their brains were examined 5 and 30~min later. At 5~min, immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy revealed A{$\beta$} on the outer aspects of cortical arteries colocalized with {$\alpha$}-2 laminin in the pial-glial basement membranes. At 30~min, A{$\beta$} was colocalised with collagen IV in smooth muscle cell basement membranes in the walls of cortical arteries corresponding to the IPAD pathways. No evidence for drainage along the walls of veins was found. Measurements of the depth of penetration of tracer were taken from 11 regions of the brain. Maximum depths of penetration of tracer into the brain were achieved in the pons and caudoputamen. Conclusions drawn from the present study are that tracers injected into the CSF enter and leave the brain along separate periarterial basement membrane pathways. The exit route is along IPAD pathways in which A{$\beta$} accumulates in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in Alzheimer's disease. Results from this study suggest that CSF may be a suitable route for delivery of therapies for neurological diseases, including CAA.},

We report our results from 18 cases of venous sinus stenting (VSS), the largest series in the literature, with specific focus on the rate of technical success, amelioration of the subjective symptom of headache, attendant complications, and radiographic patency on follow-up. METHODS: Review of our prospectively maintained database identified 18 patients who had undergone 19 VSS procedures for the placement of 30 stents in the past 2.5 years. Indications for treatment included a clinical diagnosis of BIH with venographic demonstration of stenosis. RESULTS: VSS was technically successful in all patients (100\%). No patient suffered a permanent complication. Three patients were lost to follow-up. The remaining 15 patients were followed clinically and asked to rate their headache severity on a scale of 1 to 10 both before and after VSS. Overall, 12 patients (80\%) qualified their headaches as better after VSS, two stated that they were the same, and one patient said that they were worse. Of 14 patients who underwent follow-up angiography, all demonstrated normal patency of the stented segments. In one of these patients, stenosis was detected on follow-up in the unstented segment of the sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb. CONCLUSIONS: VSS is highly effective (80\%) in ameliorating headache associated with BIH. The procedure is associated with a high rate of technical success (100\%), a low rate of permanent complications (0), and a high rate of stent patency on follow-up angiography (100\%).},

Specialty training is one of these provider-side variables, and surgeons who were trained in different specialties may have different outcomes on performing the same procedure.         OBJECTIVE:~         To investigate the impact of spine surgeon specialty (neurosurgery vs orthopedic surgery) on early perioperative outcome measures of elective anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF) for degenerative spine diseases.         METHODS:~         This was a retrospective, 1:1 propensity score-matched cohort study. In total, 21\,211 patients were reviewed from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Propensity score matching and subgroup analysis were performed.         RESULTS:~         In both groups (single-level/multilevel ACDF), patients operated on by neurosurgeons had longer operation time (133 vs 104 min/164 vs 138 min), shorter total hospital stay (24 vs 41 h/25 vs 46 h), and lower rates of return to operating room (0.7\% vs 2.1\%/0.6\% vs 2.4\%), nonhome discharge (1.2\% vs 4.6\%/1.0\% vs 4.9\%), discharge after postoperative day 1 (6.7\% vs 11.9\%/10.1\% vs 18.9\%), perioperative blood transfusion (0.4\% vs 2.1\%/0.6\% vs 3.1\%), and sepsis (0.2\% vs 0.7\%/0.1\% vs 0.7\%; P {$<$} .05). In the single-level ACDF group, patients operated on by neurosurgeons had lower readmission (1.9\% vs 4.1\%) and unplanned intubation rates (0.1\% vs 1.1\%; P {$<$} .05). Other outcome measures and mortality rates were similar among the 2 cohorts in both groups.         CONCLUSION:~         Our analysis found significant differences in early perioperative outcomes of patients undergoing ACDF by neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons. These differences might have significant clinical and cost implications for patients, physicians, program directors, payers, and health systems.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Narrative review. OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive narrative review of cervical alignment parameters, the methods for quantifying cervical alignment, normal cervical alignment values, and how alignment is associated with cervical deformity and myelopathy with discussions of health-related quality of life. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Indications for surgery to correct cervical alignment are not well-defined and there is no set standard to address the amount of correction to be achieved. In addition, classifications of cervical deformity have yet to be fully established and treatment options defined and clarified. METHODS: A survey of the cervical spine literature was conducted. RESULTS: New normative cervical alignment values from an asymptomatic volunteer population are introduced, updated methods for quantifying cervical alignment are discussed, and describing the relationship between cervical alignment, disability, and myelopathy are outlined. Specifically, methods used to quantify cervical alignment include cervical lordosis, cervical sagittal vertical axis, and horizontal gaze with the chin-brow vertical angle. Updated methods include T1 slope. Evidence from a few recent studies suggests correlations between radiographical parameters in the cervical spine and health-related quality of life. Analysis of the cervical regional alignment with respect to overall spinal pelvic alignment is emerging and critical. Cervical myelopathy and sagittal alignment of the cervical spine are closely related as cervical deformity can lead to spinal cord compression and tension. CONCLUSION: Cervical deformity correction should take on a comprehensive approach in assessing global cervical-pelvic relationships and the radiographical parameters that effect health-related quality of life scores are not well-defined. Cervical alignment may be important in assessment and treatment of cervical myelopathy. Future work should concentrate on correlation of cervical alignment parameters to disability scores and myelopathy outcomes. SUMMARY STATEMENTS: STATEMENT 1: Cervical sagittal alignment (cervical SVA and kyphosis) is related to thoracolumbar spinal pelvic alignment and to T1 slope. STATEMENT 2: When significant deformity is clinically or radiographically suspected, regional cervical and relative global spinal alignment should be evaluated preoperatively via standing 3-foot scoliosis X-rays for appropriate operative planning. STATEMENT 3: Cervical sagittal alignment (C2-C7 SVA) is correlated to regional disability, general health scores and to myelopathy severity. STATEMENT 4: When performing decompressive surgery for CSM, consideration should be given to correction of cervical kyphosis and cervical sagittal imbalance (C2-C7 SVA) when present.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Access to the ventral intradural spinal canal may be required for treatment of a variety of lesions affecting the spinal cord and adjacent intradural structures. Adequate exposure is usually achieved through a standard posterior laminectomy or posterolateral approaches, although formal anterior approaches are used to access lesions in the subaxial cervical spine. Modifications of the standard posterior exposure as well as ventral or ventrolateral approaches are increasingly being used for treating intradural spinal pathologies. In this study, the authors review their experience with 35 consecutive cases of ventral intradural spinal lesions. METHODS: Only patients with intradural lesions located completely ventral to the dentate ligament attachments were included in this retrospective study. Patients with the following lesions were excluded from the study: lesions at the level of the filum terminale/cauda equina, lesions with any component that extended dorsally to the dentate ligament, or lesions with extradural extension (that is, dumbbell tumors) below the C-2 level. Between January 2000 and September 2009, a total of 35 patients (age range 17-72 years, mean 42.6 years) with ventral intradural spinal pathology underwent surgery at the authors' institution. RESULTS: There were 28 intradural extramedullary mass lesions: 15 meningiomas, 12 solitary schwannomas, and 1 neuroenteric cyst. Surgical approaches to these lesions included 23 posterior or posterolateral approaches, 4 anterior approaches with corpectomy followed by tumor resection and reconstruction, and 1 lateral transforaminal resection. No patient had evidence of instability at follow-up, which ranged from 6 months to 8 years in duration. One patient had worsened spinal cord function following surgery. There were 7 patients with intramedullary lesions: 2 hemangioblastomas, 2 cavernous malformations, 2 perimedullary fistulas, and 1 astrocytoma. All but 1 were superficial pia-based lesions arising ventral to the dentate ligament. Five of the 6 pia-based lesions were successfully resected via a standard posterior laminectomy, partial facetectomy with dentate section, and spinal cord rotation. One midline pial lesion was successfully removed with a minimally invasive retropleural thoracotomy. The astrocytoma was resected through an anterior cervical corpectomy, which was followed by instrumented reconstruction. There were no significant complications or neurological morbidity at follow-up (range 9 months-6 years). CONCLUSIONS: Most intradural spinal lesions can be treated with contemporary microsurgical techniques with long-term control or cure of the lesion and preservation of neurological function. Standard posterior approaches provide adequate exposure to safely remove the vast majority of these lesions without the need for a potentially destabilizing resection of the facet or pedicle. Posterior exposures with varying degrees of lateral bone resection, dentate ligament division, and gentle cord rotation may also provide adequate exposure for safe removal of nonmidline ventrolateral superficial pial presenting spinal cord lesions. Nevertheless, in certain cases of ventral intradural lesions, anterior approaches are necessary and should be considered under appropriate circumstances.},

Rate of recurrence/residual, complications, and outcomes, in comparison with standard microdiscectomy (MD), is still debated and need further data. We performed an extensive review based on the last 6 years of surgical series, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses reported in international, English-written literature. Articles regarding patients treated through endoscopic transforaminal or interlaminar approaches for microdiscectomy (MD) were included in the present review. Papers focused on endoscopic surgery for other spinal diseases were not included. From July 2009 to July 2015, we identified 51 surgical series, 5 systematic reviews, and one meta-analysis reported. In lumbar EDS, rate of complications, length of hospital staying, return to daily activities, and overall patients' satisfaction seem comparable to standard MD. Rate of recurrence/residual seems higher in EDS, although data are nonhomogeneous among different series. Surgical indication and experience of the performing surgeon are crucial factors affecting the outcome. There is growing but still weak evidence that lumbar EDS is a valid and safe alternative to standard open microdiscectomy. Statistically reliable data obtained from randomized controlled trials (better if multicentric) are desirable to further confirm these results.},

OBJECTIVE: To measure the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR myelography (MRM) for symptomatic foraminal stenosis in patients who need surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: MR images are extensively used in the evaluation of foraminal stenosis and are often used to evaluate nerves exiting from the foramen. There has been no published report of the diagnostic performance of these imaging methods (MRI and MRM). METHODS: Diagnostic performances were studied in 90 patients in whom the site of the stenosis was confirmed by means of selective decompression surgeries. The disease prevalence among patients was 26\% (23 of 90 patients). The disease prevalence among foramens was 3\% (25 of 936 foramens). The prevalence of abnormal findings in 27 asymptomatic volunteers was also studied. Two blinded observers interpreted foraminal narrowing on combinations of sagittal and axial MR images, abnormalities of the course of the nerve root in the foramen, and spinal nerve swelling on MRM. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of MRI for the diagnosis of symptomatic foraminal stenosis were 96\%, 67\%, 4\%, and 100\%, respectively. The corresponding values for abnormal nerve root course on MRM were 96\%, 83\%, 7\%, and 100\%, respectively, and for spinal nerve swelling on MRM were 60\%, 99\%, 35\%, and 99\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conventional MRI, MRM affords more specific information for the presurgical diagnosis of symptomatic foraminal stenosis.},

Evidence suggests that children exhibit a specific pathological response to TBI with distinct accompanying neurological symptoms, and considerable efforts have been made to elucidate their pathophysiology. In addition, recent technical advances in diagnostic imaging of pediatric TBI has facilitated accurate diagnosis, appropriate treatment, prevention of complications, and helped predict long-term outcomes.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although spinal meningiomas respond favorably to surgical excision, their surgical management is impacted by several factors. This study utilized a surgery-based grading system to discuss the optimal surgical strategy. METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive patients who underwent surgery for spinal meningiomas were included in this retrospective study. The patients' neurological condition was assessed using the modified McCormick functional schema (mMFS) and sensory pain scale (SPS), and tumor removal was assessed using Simpson grade. Major factors contributing to surgical difficulty included; tumor size, extent/severity of cord compression, location of tumor attachment, spinal level, and anatomical relationships plus tumor extending in a dumbbell shape and local postoperative recurrence. RESULTS: Fifteen cases were classified as ventral attachment (65.2\%). There were two dumbbell-shaped tumors and three local recurrences at the primary site. Simpson grade 1 or 2 resections were performed in 18 of 20 cases (90\%) with preoperative surgical grades 0 to 3. Simpson grade 4 resections were achieved in all three cases with preoperative surgical grades 4 to 5. Overall neurological assessment after surgery revealed the satisfactory or acceptable recovery on mMFS and SPS analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Lower preoperative grade yielded better results, while the higher the preoperative grade, the more likely tumor was insufficiently removed. A preoperative surgical grading system appeared to be helpful when considering the surgical strategy. Ventral meningiomas could be safely resected via the posterolateral or lateral approach using technical modifications. Recurrent tumors, especially with ventral attachment, were hard to resolve, and primary surgery appears to be important.},

The cine-mode magnetic resonance images of these patients were compared with those of 12 normal pediatric and adult subjects. The craniocervical junction was imaged by 16 cardiac-gated velocity-encoded images arranged in a cine loop. These images allowed the measurement of both the magnitude and direction of CSF velocity. Velocity measurements were made in four regions of interest--the foramen Magendie, the foramen magnum, and ventral and dorsal to the spinal cord at C2--and were plotted in relation to the cardiac cycle to produce a CSF velocity profile. All patients who underwent surgery had the same procedure: a posterior fossa craniectomy with C1 laminectomy, lysis of arachnoid adhesions, and duraplasty. Normal subjects had unobstructed flow around the craniocervical junction: a short period of cranial CSF flow was followed by a sustained period of caudal CSF flow. Patients with tonsillar herniation of more than 5 mm had obstructed CSF flow, decreased CSF velocity, and shorter periods of caudal CSF flow. These patients also had preferential cranial CSF flow as compared with the controls. Postoperatively, there was a substantial increase in both the velocity of CSF flow and in the period of caudal CSF flow in the foramen magnum. The postoperative changes mirrored the velocity profiles of the normal subjects. These changes in CSF velocity and direction correlated with a more normal-appearing foramen magnum, a reduction in syrinx size, and an improvement in symptoms.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Ventral foramen magnum meningiomas (VFMMs) are rare lesions that account for more than 3\% of all meningiomas. These are among the most challenging of all meningiomas to treat. The authors comprehensively analyzed multiple features in a series of VFMMs. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed of 18 patients who harbored a meningioma in the ventral foramen magnum (mean follow-up period, 40 months) and underwent surgery via a transcondylar approach. Sixteen patients underwent surgery for the first time: 12 underwent gross-total (75\%), two near-total (12.5\%), and two subtotal (12.5\%) tumor removal. The remaining two patients were treated for a recurrent tumor. After obtaining postoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) scores at follow up, statistically significant improvement was demonstrated compared with the preoperative scores. The extent of surgery and higher preoperative KPS scores were variables that showed statistically significant favorable influence on outcome. Ninth and 10th cranial nerve deficits were the most common complications contributing to a prolonged hospital stay. There were no perioperative deaths. Four patients died during the follow-up period. The first patient died of multiple myeloma. The second patient, in whom surgery was performed to treat a recurrent tumor, died 3 years after the surgery of new tumor recurrence at the age of 80 years. The remaining two patients died 1.5 and 5 months postsurgery of pulmonary embolus and endocarditis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ventral foramen magnum meningiomas can be radically resected in a majority of patients, with frequent but transient morbidity caused by lower cranial nerve deficits. Radical removal of a recurrent tumor provides a relatively long, stable postoperative course. In patients presenting with a low KPS score a poor prognosis is demonstrated, and early diagnosis and treatment are recommended to avoid it.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Forty-two patients with cervical dumbbell tumors were analyzed retrospectively using a new three-dimensional classification. OBJECTIVES: To establish optimal surgical strategies, we considered shapes and three-dimensional locations of cervical dumbbell tumors based on diagnostic images and intraoperative findings. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Eden's classification for dumbbell tumors of the spine, long considered a "gold standard," no longer is sufficient to determine surgical strategy in view of recent advances in computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: Forty-two cervical dumbbell tumors were characterized according to transverse-section images (Toyama classification; nine types) and craniocaudal extent of intervertebral and transverse foraminal involvement (IF and TF staging; three stages each). RESULTS: Type IIIa tumors, involving dura plus an intervertebral foramen, accounted for 50\% of cases. A posterior approach was used in 35 patients; 7 others underwent a combined anterior and posterior approach. A posterior approach was used for all type IIa and IIIa tumors, and for some type IIIb (upper cervical), IV, and VI tumors; a combined posterior and anterior approach was used for type IIb and the remainder of type IV and VI. Reconstruction was performed using spinal instrumentation in 4 patients (9.5\%). Resection was subtotal in 6 patients (14.3\%) and total in 36 (85.7\%). CONCLUSIONS: Systematic, imaging-based three-dimensional characterization of shape and location of cervical dumbbell tumors is essential for planning optimal surgery. The classification used here fulfills this need.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective observational cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To assess long-term outcomes of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis treated surgically or nonsurgically. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The relative benefit of various treatments for lumbar spinal stenosis is uncertain. Surgical treatment has been associated with short-term improvement, but recurrence of symptoms has been documented. Few studies have compared long-term outcomes of surgical and nonsurgical treatments. METHODS: Patients recruited from the practices of orthopaedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and occupational medicine physicians throughout Maine had baseline interviews with follow-up questionnaires mailed at regular intervals over 10 years. Clinical data were obtained at baseline from a physician questionnaire. Most patients initially undergoing surgery had a laminectomy without fusion performed. Outcomes including patient-reported symptoms of leg and back pain, functional status, and satisfaction were assessed at 8- to 10-year follow-up. Primary analyses were based on initial treatment received with secondary analyses examining actual treatment received by 10 years. RESULTS: Of 148 eligible consenting patients initially enrolled, 105 were alive after 10 years (67.7\% survival rate). Among surviving patients, long-term follow-up between 8 and 10 years was available for 97 of 123 (79\%) patients (including 11 patients who died before the 10-year follow-up but completed a 8 or 9 year survey); 56 of 63 (89\%) initially treated surgically and 41 of 60 (68\%) initially treated nonsurgically. Patients undergoing surgery had worse baseline symptoms and functional status than those initially treated nonsurgically. Outcomes at 1 and 4 years favored initial surgical treatment. After 8 to 10 years, a similar percentage of surgical and nonsurgical patients reported that their low back pain was improved(53\% vs. 50\%, P = 0.8), their predominant symptom (either back or leg pain) was improved (54\% vs. 42\%, P = 0.3), and they were satisfied with their current status (55\% vs. 49\%, P = 0.5). These treatment group findings persisted after adjustment for other determinants of outcome in multivariate models. However, patients initially treated surgically reported less severe leg pain symptoms and greater improvement in back-specific functional status after 8 to 10 years than nonsurgically treated patients. By 10 years, 23\% of surgical patients had undergone at least one additional lumbar spine operation, and 39\% of nonsurgical patients had at least one lumbar spine operation. Patients undergoing subsequent surgical procedures had worse outcomes than those continuing with their initial treatment. Outcomes according to actual treatment received at 10 years did not differ because individuals undergoing additional surgical procedures had worse outcomes than those continuing with their initial treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with lumbar spinal stenosis completing 8- to 10-year follow-up, low back pain relief, predominant symptom improvement, and satisfaction with the current state were similar in patients initially treated surgically or nonsurgically. However, leg pain relief and greater back-related functional status continued to favor those initially receiving surgical treatment. These results support a shared decision-making approach among physicians and patients when considering treatment options for lumbar spinal stenosis.},

METHODS: Operative charts and videos of patients undergoing MED were retrieved from our database and reviewed. A description of the surgical technique was then formulated. CONCLUSIONS: The surgical technique of MED is described and is essentially similar to conventional microdiscectomy. Some modifications are, however, necessary owing to the difference between microscopic and endoscopic views.},

The affected nerve root was decompressed by interlaminar medial foraminotomy followed by lateral laminotomy and foraminotomy using a microsurgical technique. The procedure aimed at preserving bony continuity of the pars interarticularis and segmental motion. Neurological results showed a favourable improvement of radicular symptoms and of intermittent claudication. The need for segmental fusion at the operated segment was excluded in 30 patients, but one patient subsequently required a transpedicular screw procedure with bone grafting.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is a common cause of progressive thoracic myelopathy in East Asia. Good surgical results are expected for patients who already show myelopathy. Surgical decompression using a posterior approach is commonly used to treat OLF. This study investigated the use of microendoscopic posterior decompression for the treatment of thoracic OLF. METHODS: Microendoscopic posterior decompression was performed on 9 patients with myelopathy. Patients had a mean age of 59.8~years and single-level involvement, mostly at the T10-11 and T11-12 vertebrae. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were used to classify the OLF. A tubular retractor and endoscopic system were used for microendoscopic posterior decompression. Midline and unilateral paramedian approaches were performed in 2 and 7 patients, respectively. Intraoperative motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of 7 patients were monitored. Pre- and postoperative neurological status was evaluated using the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score. RESULTS: Thoracic OLF for all patients were classed as bilateral type with a round morphology. Improvement of MEPs at least one muscle area was recorded in all patients following posterior decompression. A dural tear in one patient was the only observed complication. The mean recovery rate was 44.9~\%, as calculated from mJOA scores at a mean follow-up period of 20~months. CONCLUSIONS: Microendoscopic posterior decompression combined with MEP monitoring can be used to treat patients with thoracic OLF. The optimal surgical indication is OLF at a single vertebral level and of a unilateral or bilateral nature, without comma and tram track signs, and a round morphology.},

Surgical treatment is recommended for patients with myelopathy. Generally, open posterior decompression, with or without fusion, is selected to treat OLF. We performed minimally invasive posterior decompression using a microendoscope and investigated the efficacy of this approach in treating limited type of thoracic OLF. Materials and Methods: Microendoscopic posterior decompression was performed for 19 patients (15 men and four women) with thoracic OLF with myelopathy aged between 35 to 81 years (mean age, 61.9 years). Neurological examination and preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) were used to identify the location and morphology of OLF. The surgery was performed using a midline approach or a unilateral paramedian approach depending on whether the surgeon used a combination of a tubular retractor and endoscope. The numerical rating scale (NRS) and modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) scores were compared pre- and postoperatively. Perioperative complications and the presence of other spine surgeries before and after thoracic OLF surgery were also investigated. Results: Four midline and 15 unilateral paramedian approaches were performed. The average operative time per level was 99 min, with minor blood loss. Nine patients had a history of cervical or lumbar spine surgery before or after thoracic spine surgery. The mean pre- and postoperative NRS scores were 6.6 and 5.3, respectively. The mean recovery rate as per the mJOA score was 33.1\% (mean follow-up period, 17.8 months), the recovery rates were significantly different between patients who underwent thoracic spine surgery alone (50.5\%) and patients who underwent additional spine surgeries (13.7\%). Regarding adverse events, one patient experienced dural tear, another experienced postoperative hematoma, and one other underwent reoperation for adjacent thoracic stenosis. Conclusion: Microendoscopic posterior decompression was applicable in limited type of thoracic OLF surgery including beak-shaped type and multi vertebral levels. However, whole spine evaluation is important to avoid missing other combined stenoses that may affect outcomes.},

METHODS: From September, 2014 to June, 2015, we enrolled 45 subjects (18 women and 27 men, mean age, 61.7~{$\pm~$}13.4~years) to undergo cervical cine MRI. The subjects were divided into three groups: no stenosis and cervical stenosis with and without intramedullary T2 hyperintensity. We measured maximal CSF velocity, and 12 CSF velocity waveforms were plotted per subject. Two readers independently assessed the CSF waveform shape (0 absent; 1 serrated; 2 bi-directional with small amplitude; and 3 normal bi-directional waveform) and the CSF motion pattern (0 absent; 1 interrupted; and 2 intact). The numbers of 12 waveform shapes were summed to yield a CSF waveform score. Linear mixed model and ROC curve analyses were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Maximal CSF velocity was significantly lower in CCM (marginal mean, 2.72~cm/s) than in stenosis without intramedullary T2 hyperintensity (3.27~cm/s, p~=~0.027) and no stenosis (3.80~cm/s, p~{$<~$}0.001). Bi-phasic CSF motion was lost in cervical stenosis. CSF waveform scores of 17 (area under curve (AUC), 0.797; p~=~0.003) and 16.5 (AUC, 0.790; p~=~0.004) could predict Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score corresponding to CCM. CONCLUSIONS: Maximal CSF velocity and CSF waveform score on cine MRI decreased in CCM and was correlated with the JOA score. Thus, both quantitative and qualitative analyses using cine MRI could effectively demonstrate CSF flow alterations in CCM.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The object of this study was to evaluate the natural history, pattern, and occurrence of tumor growth and its consequences for treatment of small-sized vestibular schwannomas (VSs). METHODS: From 1990 to 2005, 386 patients underwent conservative management for VS because of the following: age {$>$} 60 years, poor health/medical risks, risk of deterioration of good hearing, small tumor size, minimal or no incapacitating symptoms, and/or patient preference. Tumor size was measured by MR imaging according to the guidelines of the Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium. The first MR imaging study was performed 1 year after diagnosis, and subsequent imaging was performed yearly or every 2 years depending on the appearance of new symptoms, tumor growth, or both. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were lost to follow-up the first year after presentation. Of the 325 patients for whom 1-year follow-up data were available, 39 showed tumor growth {$>$} or = 3 mm. Conservative management was discontinued for these 39 patients. The patients who returned for follow-up were evaluated at 1- or 2-year intervals depending on tumor growth. The authors extrapolated to obtain data for 2-year intervals, yielding data for 160, 56, 21, and 8 patients at 3, 5, 7, and 9 years after initial presentation, respectively. The overall mean tumor growth rate (+/-standard deviation) was 1.15 +/- 2.4 mm/year. This rate was estimated by pooling all values of tumor growth that had been determined for all patients and dividing by the total number of "events," with each assessment constituting an event. In 58.6\% of patients, the annual tumor growth rate was {$<$} 1 mm/year; in 29.2\%, 1-3 mm/year; and in 12.2\%, {$>$} or = 3 mm/ year. The growth rates of intrameatal (1.02 +/- 1.8 mm/year) and extrameatal (1.40 +/- 3.1 mm/year) tumors did not differ significantly. No significant association was found between tumor growth rate and sex, age, initial hearing status, or initial tumor grade. Delay in diagnosis was the only significant factor associated with tumor growth rate. During follow-up, conservative management was discontinued for 77 (23.7\%) of the 325 patients for whom at least 12-month follow-up data were available; surgery was performed in 60 (77.9\%) and radiation therapy in 17 (22.1\%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support the role of a conservative "wait-and-scan" policy of management for small-sized VSs because most have a slow growth rate. Long-term neuroimaging follow-up is needed even with non-growing tumors.},

However, the risk of cervical sympathetic trunk (CST) injury and Horner's syndrome is one of the main difficulties of this demanding surgical approach. The upper necks of 3 adult human cadavers (6 sides) were dissected under a Zeiss surgical microscope. OC was performed in a stepwise manner to simulate the surgical procedure. We specifically studied the technique of the protection of the CST during the cervical OC approach. The superior ganglion of the cervical sympathetic chain is located under the prevertebral fascia over the longus capitis muscle at the level of C3 transverse process, while the CST is situated under the prevertebral fascia over the longus colli muscle. The CST courses obliquely from superolateral to inferomedial. The ganglia and CST are carefully dissected; the fascia of the longus colli muscle is cut medially, preferably in the midline over the vertebrae, and the fascia lifted up. Then, the aponeurotic flap is gently retracted laterally to cover the sympathetic chain safely and secured with a 3/0 suture laterally. Preservation of the CST while performing cervical OC is essential to avoid postoperative Horner's syndrome. The placement of self-retaining retractors, particularly inferiorly, where the sympathetic chain is located more medially, is probably the main cause of its injury. Further studies are needed documenting the incidence of Horner's syndrome in the application of this technique to live patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ventral spinal epidural meningeal cysts are rare entities for which the pathogenesis is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: We present the clinical, radiographic, surgical, and pathologic findings of 4 patients with extensive ventral spinal epidural meningeal cysts and review the relevant literature. In addition, we discuss a suspected mechanism for pathogenesis. METHODS: Four patients with anterior spinal epidural meningeal cysts are retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Ventral spinal epidural meningeal cysts are often large, extending on average from C2 to L1 in our series. Patients typically present with a prolonged course of symptoms and signs, including segmental muscle weakness and atrophy, subtle myelopathy, mild to moderate spinal pain, and headache. Histopathologic analysis of the cyst wall demonstrates collagenous tissue consistent with dura but without arachnoid features. Dynamic computed tomographic myelography is the study of choice for localization of the primary dural defect. Patient symptoms and neurological deficits routinely improve after appropriate surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: Diverse signs and symptoms herald the presentation of ventral spinal meningoceles. Intraoperative, radiographic, and pathological findings are all suggestive of an intradural dissection as the etiology. Hence, they may be more appropriately named "ventral spinal intradural dissecting meningoceles." Definitive treatment involves identification and obliteration of the dural defect.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the effects of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bidirectional motion in Chiari malformation type I (CMI), we monitored CSF velocity amplitudes on phase contrast MRI (PC-MRI) in patients before and after surgery; and in healthy volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 10 pediatric volunteers and 10 CMI patients participated in this study. CMI patients underwent PC-MRI scans before and approximately 14 months following surgery. Two parameters-amplitude of mean velocity (AMV) and amplitude of peak velocity (APV) of CSF-were derived from the data. Measurements were made at the mid-portion of the cerebral aqueduct, and anterior and posterior compartments of the spinal canal at the craniovertebral junction (CVJ). RESULTS: AMV and APV within the cerebral aqueduct were greater in preoperative assessments of the CMI patients compared to normal volunteers. Statistical significance was noted when comparing aqueductal AMV between the preoperative values and normal controls (P\,=\,0.03), and before and after surgery in the CMI patients (P\,=\,0.02). Lower values of AMV (P\,=\,0.02) were noted in the anterior CVJ compartment in the patients before and after surgery when compared to the normal volunteers. There were no significant correlations (P\,=\,0.06) noted for the APV at the CVJ between the normal control and patients, before or after surgery. CONCLUSION: In pediatric CMI patients, AMV for CSF within the cerebral aqueduct and anterior CVJ subarachnoid space are significantly elevated preoperatively and normalize following surgery. Given the biphasic CSF motion, measuring amplitude accounts for cranial and caudal flow. It may offer an alternative parameter to assess postsurgical outcome. J. Magn. Reson.

We measured the position of the cerebellar tonsils with respect to the inferior aspect of the foramen magnum in 200 normal patients and in 25 patients with a firm diagnosis of Chiari I malformation. In the normal group, the mean position of the tonsils was 1 mm above the foramen magnum with a range from 8 mm above the foramen magnum to 5 mm below. In the patients with Chiari I malformations, the mean position was 13 mm below the foramen magnum with a range from 3 mm below the foramen magnum to 29 mm below. Fourteen percent of normal patients had tonsils extending slightly below the foramen magnum. If 2 mm below the foramen magnum is taken as the lowest extent for tonsils in a normal patient, our sensitivity in predicting symptomatic patients is 100\% and our specificity is 98.5\% (three false positives). If 3 mm below the foramen magnum is taken as the lowest normal tonsillar position, our sensitivity is 96\% and our specificity is 99.5\%. MR demonstration of less than 2 mm of tonsillar ectopia is probably of no clinical significance in the absence of syringomyelia.},

  abstract = {It has long been recognized that a clinical syndrome similar to idiopathic intracranial hypertension can occur secondary to venous sinus obstruction with the elevation in sinus pressure causing a reversal in the pressure gradient across the arachnoid granulations and therefore elevated CSF pressure. There remains, however, a group of predominantly obese female patients with elevated CSF pressures who have either no apparent abnormality of venous outflow or a tapering, apparently extrinsic compression, of their dominant transverse sinuses on catheter venography. This suggests that venous collapse may be associated in some way with the cause of the elevated pressure but clearly something else must be initiating the pressure rise or a circular argument ensues. Elevated CSF pressure compresses the veins, which then elevates CSF pressure. However, collapse of the venous sinuses secondary to the elevated CSF pressure once initiated may exacerbate the condition. It has been suggested that the initiating event leading to the elevated pressures in the idiopathic group of patients may be caused by cerebral hyperaemia and cerebral dysautoregulation. Priapism is a condition of pathological elevation of venous pressure of the male genitalia in which there are two forms: (1) venous out flow obstruction and (2) hyperaemia due to a to loss of regulation of blood flow and secondary venous out flow compression. Review of the literature suggests the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension may be analogous to that of priapism.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: A collapsible segment in the venous outflow has been noted in many patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Mathematical modeling has shown that these collapsible segments can account for the elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressures associated with IIH. However, the model required an elevated outflow resistance of up to 10 times normal to predict the CSF pressures actually found clinically. Measurement of blood flow in patients with IIH has shown that inflow rates vary, with higher rates noted in patients with lesser outflow stenoses. The aim of this work was to extend a simple model of cerebral hydrodynamics to accommodate a collapsible sinus and elevations in cerebral blood flow in accordance with in vivo measurements. METHODS: Forty patients with IIH underwent MR imaging in which the degree of stenosis on MR venography was compared with the total blood inflow by using MR flow quantification. The relative outflow resistance in IIH was estimated using the CSF opening pressure. The patients were compared with 14 age-matched control individuals. RESULTS: Patients were divided into 3 groups based on MR venography appearances (minimal stenosis, stenosis of 40-70\% and {$>$} 70\% stenosis). In vivo measurements suggested a relative resistance elevation of 2.5 times normal, 4.2 times normal, and 4.8 times normal in the 3 groups, respectively. There was an increased inflow of 1.56 times normal, 1.28 times normal, and 1.19 times normal in these groups. CONCLUSIONS: The model correctly predicted the CSF pressures noted in vivo, suggesting that high arterial inflow is required for patients with low-grade stenoses to be symptomatic.},

METHODS: In a follow-up analysis of 42 patients in whom shunts were placed in syringomyelic cavities, the authors have demonstrated that 21 (50\%) developed recurrent cyst expansion indicative of shunt failure. Problems were encountered in patients with syringomyelia resulting from hindbrain herniation, spinal trauma, or inflammatory processes. A low-pressure cerebrospinal fluid state occurred in two of 18 patients; infection was also rare (one of 18 patients), but both are potentially devastating complications of shunt procedures. Shunt obstruction, the most common problem, was encountered in 18 patients; spinal cord tethering, seen in three cases, may account for situations in which the patient gradually deteriorated neurologically, despite a functioning shunt. CONCLUSIONS: Placement of all types of shunts (subarachnoid, syringoperitoneal, and syringopleural) may be followed by significant morbidity requiring one or more additional surgical procedures.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine the natural history of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Most studies on the natural history of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis are based on patient populations presenting with pain. Critical to any natural history investigation is the study of a population of affected individuals, whether symptomatic or not, from onset of the condition through their lives. METHODS: By study of a population from the age of 6 years to adulthood, 30 individuals were identified to have pars lesions. Data collection at a 45-year follow-up assessment included magnetic resonance imaging, a back pain questionnaire, and the SF-36 Survey. RESULTS: No subject with a pars defect was lost to follow-up evaluation once a lesion was identified. Subjects with unilateral defects never experienced slippage over the course of the study. Progression of spondylolisthesis slowed with each decade. There was no association of slip progression and low back pain. There was no statistically significant difference between the study population SF-36 scores and those of the general population the same age. CONCLUSIONS: This report is the only prospective study to document the natural history of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis from onset through more than 45 years of life in a population unselected for pain. Subjects with pars defects follow a clinical course similar to that of the general population. There appears to be a marked slowing of slip progression with each decade, and no subject has reached a 40\% slip.},

Four regions of interest were selected in the upper cervical subarachnoid space and premedullary cistern. Velocity and fraction of the cardiac cycle waveforms were plotted, and amplitude, temporal, and CSF displacement parameters were assessed. RESULTS: In the Chiari I patients, impaired systolic and unaltered diastolic CSF flow pulsations immediately below the foramen magnum were identified. After surgery, the systolic flow pulsations immediately below the foramen magnum improved. Good correlation with post-surgical improvement was observed.

Theories of pathogenesis are considered, the clinical presentation is described, and potential diagnostic and therapeutic challenges are explored. METHODS: An extensive literature review of IIH and related conditions (secondary pseudotumor syndromes) was performed. The history of and rationale for the diagnosis and medical and surgical approaches to treatment are reviewed. Available outcome studies are presented. RESULTS: Diagnosis of IIH requires that the modified Dandy criteria be satisfied. Multiple potential contributing causes of intracranial hypertension must be identified or excluded. The clinical presentation most often includes headaches and papilledema, but many other findings have been described. The most important goal of therapy is to prevent or arrest progressive visual loss. Medical therapies include alleviation of associated systemic diseases, discontinuation of contributing medications, provision of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and weight loss. Surgical therapies include lumboperitoneal shunting, ventriculoperitoneal shunting, and optic nerve sheath fenestration. On the basis of the advantages and disadvantages of these treatment modalities, a suggested treatment paradigm is presented. CONCLUSION: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is the term to be adopted instead of pseudotumor cerebri. IIH remains an enigmatic diagnosis of exclusion. However, prompt diagnosis and thorough evaluation and treatment are crucial for preventing visual loss and improving associated symptoms.},

  abstract = {Postoperative atrophy of the deep back muscles may be caused by denervation during a dorsomedian approach to the thoracolumbar spine; ensuing instability of the spine with poor clinical results, perhaps due to such muscle loss, has been observed in 11.7\% of cases (Sihvonen et al., 1993, Spine 18:575--581). More specifically, this complication may be caused by damaging the medial branches of the posterior rami of the spinal nerves during lateral retraction of the muscles. To investigate the anatomic topography of the medial branches of the posterior rami of the spinal nerves, 18 carbol-formol-fixed specimens were dissected using an operation microscope; also, 3 fresh cadavers were cut in horizontal and vertical planes with a rotary cryotome to confirm the anatomic topography observed in the fixed specimens. In the thoracolumbar spine the medial branch of the posterior ramus of the spinal nerve is subject to ligamentous fixation by the strong fibers of the mammillo-accessory ligament, which extends between the mammillary process and accessory process infero lateral to the superior articular process. When the dorsomedian approach to the thoracolumbar spine is enlarged laterally to the articular processes by retracting the paraspinous muscles, the medial branches of the posterior rami of the spinal nerves are endangered. This may cause postoperative pain as well as dynamic instability beyond the corresponding segments. The results of our anatomic study suggest that the posterior surgical midline approach to the thoracolumbar spine should not be enlarged laterally to the articular processes to prevent injury to the medial branches of the posterior rami of the spinal nerves.},

  abstract = {Most patients with chronic back pain suffer from degenerative thoracolumbovertebral disease. However, the following case illustrates that a localized peripheral nerve entrapment must be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic back pain. We report the case of a 26-year-old woman with continuous excruciating pain in the lower back area. Previous treatment for nephroptosis was to no avail. On physical examination the pain was present in a 2 x 2 cm area overlying the twelfth rib some 4 cm lateral to the spinal process. Somatosensory testing using swab and alcohol gauze demonstrated the presence of skin hypo- and dysesthesia over the painful area. Local pressure on this painful spot elicited an extreme pain response that did not irradiate towards the periphery. These findings were highly suggestive of a posterior version of the anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES), a condition leading to a severe localized neuropathic pain in anterior portions of the abdominal wall. She demonstrated a beneficial albeit temporary response after lidocaine infiltration as dictated by an established diagnostic and treatment protocol for ACNES. She subsequently underwent a local neurectomy of the involved superficial branch of the intercostal nerve. This limited operation had a favorable outcome resulting in a pain-free return to normal activities up to this very day (follow-up of 24 months).We propose to name this novel syndrome "posterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome" (POCNES). Each patient with chronic localized back pain should undergo simple somatosensory testing to detect the presence of overlying skin hypo- and dysesthesia possibly reflecting an entrapped posterior cutaneous nerve.Key words: Chronic pain, back pain, posterior cutaneous nerve entrapment, peripheral nerve entrapment, surgical treatment for pain, anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment.},

Most modern surgical series have documented improvement in symptomatic patients who have an internal decompression of their syrinx. Several  options exist and include shunting the syrinx (to the subarachnoid space or to either the pleural or peritoneal cavities) as well as spinal cord untethering (with or without expansile duraplasty). METHODS: A systematic review of literature followed by expert panel consensus was performed.

Case reports and articles examining syrinx due to other cause were excluded. Articles were graded  for strength of evidence according to the GRADE approach. The evidentiary tables  were reviewed and approved by all 4 authors, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. RESULTS: The literature search yielded a total of 296 abstracts, and 22 articles were found to fulfill all the criteria specified above.

The literature does not support surgical intervention for incidental, asymptomatic syrinx. The literature does not support one surgical technique as superior for the treatment of post-traumatic syringomyelia. CONCLUSION: The literature supports and the consensus panel recommended that there is no indication for direct decompression at the time of initial injury specifically for the purpose of limiting future risk of syringomyelia. The literature supports and the consensus panel gave a strong recommendation for surgical intervention in the setting of motor neurologic deterioration as a consequence of post-traumatic  syrinx/tethered cord. The panel gave a weak recommendation against surgical intervention for patients developing sensory loss/pain syndrome or for asymptomatic but expanding syrinx. Finally, the literature does not provide strong evidence to support the superiority of one surgical technique over the others; however, the consensus panel gave a weak recommendation that spinal cord  untethering with expansile duraplasty is the preferred first-line surgical technique.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether TS stenosis changed after normalization of CSF pressure in patients with IIH during medical treatment. METHODS: Fourteen consecutive patients with IIH with bilateral TS stenosis on cerebral MR venography (MRV) during the medical treatment were studied. Patients were followed for over a 6-year period. During the follow-up, patients underwent repeated lumbar punctures (LPs) and cerebral MRV. MRV was always performed before each LP. RESULTS: TS stenosis persisted in all the patients during the follow-up. In 9 of 14 (64\%) patients with IIH, CSF pressure normalized during medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Transverse sinus (TS) stenoses, as revealed by MR venography, persist in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension after normalization of CSF pressure, suggesting the lack of a direct relationship between the caliber of TS and CSF pressure.},

METHODS: A retrospective study of all confirmed cases of syringomyelia diagnosed in residents of northern New Zealand from 1961 to 2003. RESULTS: In all, syringomyelia was diagnosed in 137 patients. The mean age at onset of symptoms was 27.5 years and mean age at diagnosis was 32.6 years. The incidence of new cases increased from 0.76/100,000 a year between 1962 and 1971 to 4.70/100,000 a year by 1992-2001. The prevalence of syringomyelia in 2003 was 8.2/100,000 people: 5.4/100,000 in Caucasians or others, 15.4/100,000 in Maori and 18.4/100,000 in Pacific people (chi2 = 37.0, p{$<$}0.0001). Syringomyelia was more often associated with an isolated Chiari I malformation in Pacific people (84.4\%) as compared with 42.9\% of Maori and 38.2\% of Caucasians or others (chi2 = 62.3, p{$<$}0.0001). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of syringomyelia is higher in northern New Zealand than in studies carried out before the advent of magnetic resonance imaging. The prevalence is particularly high in Maori and Pacific people. The cause of the ethnic differences in the prevalence of syringomyelia identified in this study is unexplained and warrants further investigation.},

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion from the subarachnoid space on perivascular flow (PVS) and syrinx formation in posttraumatic syringomyelia. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In an animal model of PTS, fluid enters syringes from the subarachnoid space via perivascular spaces. Preferential PVS flow occurs at the level of the syrinx. It has been suggested that arachnoiditis predisposes to posttraumatic syringomyelia formation by obstructing subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid flow and enhancing perivascular flow. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were investigated using the CSF tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP), the excitotoxic model of PTS, and lumboperitoneal shunt insertion. Five experimental groups consisted of normal controls, syrinx only and shunt only controls, and shunt insertion before or after syrinx formation. In all groups except normal controls, CSF flow studies were performed 6 weeks after the final intervention. Grading scales were used to quantify HRP staining. RESULTS: All excitotoxic model animals formed syringes. Perivascular flow was greatest at the level of the syrinx. Cerebral cortex perivascular flow was significantly reduced after shunt insertion in animals with a syrinx (P {$<$} 0.05). Shunt insertion did not alter syrinx length or size. There were no significant differences between shunt and syrinx first groups. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing caudal subarachnoid space compliance with a shunt does not affect local CSF flow into the spinal cord and syrinx. These results suggest that localized alterations in compliance, as opposed to obstruction from traumatic arachnoiditis, may act as an important factor in syrinx pathogenesis.},

Methods First-degree unaffected relatives of those with a familial history of IA who had a history of smoking or hypertension but no known IA were offered cerebral magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and followed yearly as part of an NINDS-funded study of familial IA (FIA Study). Results 2874 subjects from 542 FIA families were enrolled. After study enrollment, MRAs were performed in 548 FIA family members with no known history of IA. Of these 548 subjects, 113 subjects (20.6\%) had 148 IAs by MRA of whom 5 subjects had IA {$>$}= 7 mm. Two subjects with an unruptured IA by MRA/CTA (3 mm and 4mm ACOM) subsequently had rupture of their IA. This represents an annual rate of 1.2 ruptures per 100 subjects (1.2\% per year, 95\% CI of 0.14\% to 4.3\% per year). None of the 435 subjects with a negative MRA have had a ruptured IA. Survival curves between the MRA positive and negative cohorts were significantly different (p = 0.004). This rupture rate of unruptured IA in the FIA cohort of 1.2\% per year is approximately 17 times higher than the rupture rate for subjects with an unruptured IA in the International Study of Unruptured Aneurysm Study with a matched distribution of IA size and location - 0.069\% per year. Conclusions Small unruptured IAs in patients from FIA families may have a higher risk of rupture than sporadic unruptured IAs of similar size, which should be considered in the management of these patients.},

More recently, the interspinous process spacer (ISP), developed to treat straightforward spinal stenosis, has been used in patients with spinal deformity to limit morbidity, although no studies have compared outcomes in this patient population. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of 90 consecutive patients, mean age 70 years, with 5-year mean follow-up (minimum, 2 yr), treated for stenosis with associated deformity with ISP device placement, laminectomy alone, or laminectomy and short-segment fusion. Early failure was defined as return to the operating room for revision of the index level or adjacent segment within 2 years. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed, and clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction was assessed. RESULTS: Reoperation within 2 years was noted in 16.7\% of patients treated for spinal stenosis and mild deformity. There was a significantly higher rate of same-level recurrence in the ISP group (33.3\%), than the laminectomy (8.3\%) and lami/fusion groups (0\%) (P{$<$} 0.0001). Early reoperation due to adjacent segment pathology (ASP) was most common in the lami/fusion group (13.3\%). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed lowest survival for the ISP group and highest survival in the laminectomy-alone group at 2 years (P= 0.043) and 5 years (P= 0.007). CONCLUSION: Early failure was significantly more common in patients treated with an ISP device for spinal stenosis and lumbar deformity, whereas reoperation due to symptomatic adjacent segment pathology was most common in patients treated with laminectomy and fusion. Laminectomy alone had the highest rate of survival. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.},

  abstract = {Because it is the product of glycolysis and main substrate for mitochondrial respiration, lactate is the central metabolic intermediate in cerebral energy substrate delivery. Our recent studies on healthy controls and patients following traumatic brain injury (TBI) using [6,6-2H2]glucose and [3-13C]lactate, along with cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial-venous (jugular bulb) difference measurements for oxygen, metabolite levels, isotopic enrichments and 13CO2 show a massive and previously unrecognized mobilization of lactate from corporeal (muscle, skin, and other) glycogen reserves in TBI patients who were studied 5.7 {$\pm$} 2.2 days after injury at which time brain oxygen consumption and glucose uptake (CMRO2 and CMRgluc, respectively) were depressed. By tracking the incorporation of the 13C from lactate tracer we found that gluconeogenesis (GNG) from lactate accounted for 67.1 {$\pm$} 6.9\%, of whole-body glucose appearance rate (Ra) in TBI, which was compared to 15.2 {$\pm$} 2.8\% (mean {$\pm$} SD, respectively) in healthy, well-nourished controls. Standard of care treatment of TBI patients in state-of-the-art facilities by talented and dedicated heath care professionals reveals presence of a catabolic Body Energy State (BES). Results are interpreted to mean that additional nutritive support is required to fuel the body and brain following TBI. Use of a diagnostic to monitor BES to provide health care professionals with actionable data in providing nutritive formulations to fuel the body and brain and achieve exquisite glycemic control are discussed. In particular, the advantages of using inorganic and organic lactate salts, esters and other compounds are examined. To date, several investigations on brain-injured patients with intact hepatic and renal functions show that compared to dextrose + insulin treatment, exogenous lactate infusion results in normal glycemia.},

Our purpose was to determine the CSF flow patterns in spinal cord cysts and in the subararachnoid space in patients with syringomyelia associated with Chiari I malformation and to evaluate the modifications of the flow resulting from surgery. METHODS: Eighteen patients with syringomyelia were examined with a 3D Fourier encoding velocity imaging technique. A prospectively gated 2D axial sequence with velocity encoding in the craniocaudal direction in the cervical region was set at a velocity of +/- 10 cm/s. Velocity measurements were performed in the larger portion of the cysts and, at the same cervical level, in the pericystic subarachnoid spaces. All patients underwent a surgical procedure involving dural opening followed by duroplasty. Pre- and postoperative velocity measurements of all patients were taken, with a mean follow-up of 10.2 months. We compared the velocity measurements with the morphology of the cysts and with the clinical data. Spinal subarachnoid spaces of 19 healthy subjects were also studied using the same technique. RESULTS: A pulsatile flow was observed in syrinx cavities and in the pericystic subarachnoid spaces (PCSS). Preoperative maximum systolic cyst velocities were higher than were diastolic velocities. A systolic velocity peak was well defined in all cases, first in the cyst and then in the PCSS. Higher systolic and diastolic cyst velocities are observed in large cysts and in patients with a poor clinical status. After surgery, a decrease in cyst volume (evaluated on the basis of the extension of the cyst and the compression of the PCSS) was observed in 13 patients. In the postoperative course, we noticed a decrease of systolic and diastolic cyst velocities and a parallel increase of systolic PCSS velocities. Diastolic cyst velocities correlated with the preoperative clinical status of the patients and, after surgery, in patients with a satisfactory foraminal enlargement evaluated on the basis of the visibility of the cisterna magna. CONCLUSION: CSF flow measurement constitutes a direct evaluation for the follow-up of patients with syringomyelic cysts. Diastolic and systolic cyst velocities can assist in the evaluation of the efficacy of surgery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cubital tunnel syndrome is the second most common peripheral entrapment syndrome. To date, there is no true consensus on the ideal surgical management. A minimally invasive, endoscopic approach has gained popularity but has not been adequately compared to the more traditional, open approach. METHODS: With compliance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic review was performed to identify studies published between 1990 and 2016 that compared the efficacy of endoscopic cubital tunnel release to open cubital tunnel release. A meta-analysis was then performed through a random-effects model with inverse variance weighting to calculate I values for heterogeneity analysis. Forest plots were constructed for each analysis group. RESULTS: Five studies involving 655 patients (endoscopic cubital tunnel release, n = 226; open cubital tunnel release, n = 429) were included. Meta-analysis revealed no significant superiority of open release in achieving an "excellent" or "good" Bishop score (OR, 1.27; 95 percent CI, 0.59 to 2.75; p = 0.54) and reduction in visual analogue scale score (mean difference, -0.41; 95 percent CI, -1.49 to 0.67; p = 0.46). However, in the endoscopic release cohort, lower rates of new-onset scar tenderness/elbow pain were found (OR, 0.19; 95 percent CI, 0.07 to 0.53; p = 0.002), but there was a higher incidence of postoperative hematomas (OR, 5.70; 95 percent CI, 1.20 to 27.03; p = 0.03). The reoperation rate in the endoscopic and open release groups was 4.9 and 4.1 percent, respectively (p = 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: The authors demonstrated equivalent overall clinical improvement between endoscopic and open cubital tunnel release in terms of Bishop score and visual analogue scale score reduction. Because of the low power of most studies, further investigations with a larger patient population and longer follow-up are needed to better characterize the role of endoscopic cubital tunnel release.},

The relationship between sagittal alignment and severity of lumbar stenosis has not previously been studied. PURPOSE: We hypothesized that patients with increasing radiological severity of lumbar stenosis will exhibit worsening sagittal alignment. STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Our sample consists of patients who have DLS. OUTCOME MEASURES: Standing pelvic, regional, lower extremity and global sagittal alignment, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were the outcome measures. METHODS: Patients with DLS were identified from a retrospective clinical database with corresponding full-body stereoradiographs. Exclusion criteria included coronal malalignment, prior spine surgery, spondylolisthesis{$>$}Grade 1, non-degenerative spinal pathology, or skeletal immaturity. Central stenosis severity was graded on axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from L1-S1. Foraminal stenosis and supine lordosis was graded on sagittal T1-weighted images. Standing pelvic, regional, lower extremity, and global sagittal alignment were measured using validated software. The HRQoL measures were also analyzed in relation to severity of stenosis. RESULTS: A total of 125 patients were identified with DLS on appropriate imaging. As central stenosis grade increased, patients displayed significantly increasing standing T1 pelvic angle, pelvic tilt, sagittal vertical axis, and pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis (p{$<$}.05). No significant difference wasfound in pelvic incidence, supine lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, or T1 spinopelvic inclination between central stenosis groups. Despite similar supine lordosis between stenosis groups, patients with Grades 2 and 3 stenosis had less standing lordosis, suggesting antalgic posturing. Upper lumbar (L1-L3) stenosis predicted worse alignment than lower lumbar (L4-S1) stenosis. Increasing severity of foraminal stenosis was associated with reduced lumbar lordosis; however, no significant postural difference in lordosis, thoracolumbar, or lower extremity compensatory mechanisms were noted between foraminal stenosis groups. Stenosis grading did not predict worsening HRQoLs in central or foraminal stenosis. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of central lumbar stenosis as graded on MRI correlates with severity of sagittal malalignment. These findings support theories of sagittal malalignment as a compensatory mechanism for central lumbar stenosis.},

The purpose of this study is to determine whether multimodality IONM can predict postoperative C5 palsy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 131 consecutive patients with cervical myelopathy who underwent open door laminoplasty utilizing motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring combined with somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP) and free-running electromyography (EMG). We reviewed abnormal findings in the IONM record including EMG, MEP, and SSEP changes documented as transient or persist at the end of surgery. RESULTS: Postoperative C5 palsy occurred in 3 patients (2.2\%). Two were acute in onset and one occurred 4 days postoperatively. Significant MEP alerts occurred in 12 patients. Four patients had MEP intraoperative alerts in their deltoid or biceps, of which 2 alerts were transient and 2 alerts were persistent at the end of surgery. Significant intraoperative SSEP change was not observed in this study. For the prediction of postoperative acute-onset C5 palsy, MEP alerts in the deltoid or biceps had 100\% sensitivity and 98.4\% specificity. Transient or persistent MEP alerts in the deltoid or biceps have the same positive predictive value with sensitivity of 50.0\% and specificity of 99.2\%. CONCLUSION: The incidence of any neurological deficit including C5 palsy during laminoplasty while utilizing multimodality IONM was relatively low. MEP alerts in the deltoids or biceps had 100\% sensitivity and 98.4\% specificity to predict a postoperative acute C5 palsy.},

Other common causes were recurrent or persistent disk herniation and lumbosacral adhesive arachnoiditis. The diagnosis of stenosis was made either by high-resolution CT scan of the lumbar spine or by directly testing lateral canal and for animal patency at the time of surgery. It is now appreciated that the process of degenerative disk disease, particularly when enhanced by diskectomy, results in progressive loss of intervertebral disk volume and predisposes to future ipsilateral or contralateral lateral spinal stenosis. Degenerative disk disease is ultimately a bilateral process and therefore surgical exposure should be bilateral. The direct and indirect costs of FBSS to patients and to society as well as the toll in human suffering are very high. This is particularly a matter of concern when it is realized that for many FBSS patients, surgery could have been avoided in the first place by preventive care or by innovative conservative treatment. When surgery is indicated, adequate diagnostic tests and the execution of appropriate procedures based upon this information should largely prevent the failed back surgery syndrome.},

Stent placement to remove this potential obstruction to venous outflow has been proposed as a treatment option for patients with IIH refractory to medical treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of patients with refractory IIH evaluated for venous sinus stent placement at a tertiary care center was retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Thirteen female patients with IIH were evaluated for sinovenous stent placement. Moderate sinus stenoses with normal intrasinus pressures were found in 3 patients and therefore stent placement was not performed. Ten patients had elevated intrasinus pressures (pressure gradient across stenosis, 11-50 mm Hg), which decreased following unilateral TS stent placement. Headaches improved or resolved in all stented patients. Papilledema resolved completely or almost completely in 8 patients and significantly improved in 2 patients. One patient developed optic atrophy. There were no major periprocedural complications. CONCLUSIONS: In this small case series, restoring the patency of stenotic venous sinuses with a stent in patients with refractory IIH resulted in symptomatic improvement in all treated patients. The safety and efficacy of this procedure should be evaluated in a randomized controlled study to determine its role within the armamentarium of therapeutic options for patients with IIH.},

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical and radiographic results of cervical corpectomy reconstructed with expandable cages for degenerative stenosis. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 78 patients with degenerative cervical stenosis treated with a corpectomy reconstructed with an expandable cage. We evaluated the clinical and radiographic outcomes, as well as complications of the procedure at a minimum 2-yr follow-up. RESULTS: There was a decrease in the visual analog scale pain average from 75~mm to 8.5~mm (P~=~.02); a decrease in the Neck Disability Index average from 55\% to 12\% (P~=~.009); and improvement in the Japanese Orthopaedic Association average from 12 to 14 points (P~=~.01). There was a change in cervical lordosis (Cobb method) average from -9.3\textdegree{} to -15.1\textdegree{} (P~=~.002), without significant loss of lordosis (P~=~.63). The fusion rate, by criteria of the Cervical Spine Research Society (CSRS), was low: using dynamic X-rays - 50\% (n~=~39/78) and using computed tomography (CT) - 47.4\% (n~=~37/78). A total of 11 patients (14.1\%) suffered complications. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the largest series (78) with a minimum 2-yr follow-up in the literature and the first using the dynamic radiographic and CT criteria endorsed by the CSRS. Using these criteria, our fusion rates were much lower than all previous reports in the literature. Despite this, patient-reported outcomes were reasonable. There was a relatively low incidence of perioperative complications, most of which were likely not implant-specific and there was only 1 case of implant failure.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Finite element analysis. OBJECTIVE: Via finite element analysis: (1) to demonstrate the abnormal forces present at the top of a scoliosis construct, (2) to demonstrate the importance of an intact interspinous and supraspinous ligament (ISL/SSL) complex, and (3) to evaluate a transition rod (a rod that has a short taper to a smaller diameter at one end) as an implant solution to diminish these pathomechanics, regardless of the integrity of the ISL/SSL complex. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The pathophysiology of increased nucleus pressure and increased angular displacement may contribute to proximal junctional kyphosis. Furthermore, high implant stress can be demonstrated at the upper end of the construct, possibly leading to the risk of implant failure. METHODS: A finite element model was constructed to simulate a thoracic spinal fusion. The model was altered to remove the ISL/SSL complex at the level above the construct. Then, the model was altered again by extending the construct one level superior with a transition rod. The angular displacement, the maximum pressure in the nucleus, and stress within the implant were extracted from computational results under 2 conditions: load control and displacement control. The testing was performed with both titanium and stainless steel implants. RESULTS: Pressure in the nucleus and angular displacement are all increased when the ISL/SSL complex is removed immediately above the instrumented levels, whereas the screw pullout force and maximum stress within the screw are decreased. The nucleus pressure increases by more than 50\%. The angular displacement increases by 19\% to 26\%. This absence of the ISL/SSL complex simulates the clinical scenario that occurs when these structures are iatrogenically detached. Abnormal mechanics can be restored to normal level by extending the construct rostral one level with a transition rod. Furthermore, the elevated nucleus pressure and angular displacement noted even when the ISL/SSL complex is intact can be avoided with the use of a transition rod. Under the same bending moment (3 Nm), the nucleus pressure at the level immediately cephalad is up to 23\% lower than the pressure in a standard construct. The angular displacement is 18\% to 19\% less than the standard construct. The maximum implant stress is also decreased by as much as 60\%. CONCLUSION: Finite element modeling suggests that the pathomechanics at the proximal end of a scoliosis construct may be diminished by preserving the ISL/SSL complex and possibly completely eliminated with the use of rods with a diameter transition at the most proximal level.},

  abstract = {OBJECT The objective of this study was to generate data on the local prevalence of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) in asymptomatic Hong Kong Chinese individuals. First-degree relatives of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) were recruited as surrogates of the general population and to explore the potential role of screening in this locality. METHODS The authors identified first-degree relatives of consecutive patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm who were admitted to a university hospital in Hong Kong from June 2008 to December 2010. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was the imaging modality used to screen the cerebral vasculature of these asymptomatic individuals. If MRA showed abnormal findings, CT angiography was performed to confirm the MRA findings. RESULTS In total, 7 UIAs were identified from the 305 MR angiograms obtained. The prevalence of UIAs in first-degree relatives of patients with aSAH in the Hong Kong Chinese population was 2.30\% (95\% CI1.02\%-4.76\%). This percentage was lower than the prevalence rate of 3.2\% from a meta-analysis of the literature. The sizes of the UIAs detected ranged from 1.4 mm to 7.5 mm; 85.7\% of the UIAs detected in this study were {$<$} 5 mm, in contrast to 66\% noted in the literature. One of the UIAs identified underwent endovascular stent placement with a flow diverter. None of the UIAs identified ruptured or became symptomatic during a median follow-up period of 3.5 years. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of UIAs in first-degree relatives of patients with aSAH in the Hong Kong Chinese population was lower than that in Caucasians. At the same time, most of the UIAs detected in this study were small (85.7\% were {$<$} 5 mm, vs 66\% in a meta-analysis). With a similar incidence of aSAH in Hong Kong (7.5 per 100,000 person-years) as compared with data cited in the literature, the hypothesis that UIA rupture risk size threshold is different in Chinese patients should be further investigated.},

  abstract = {The indications for surgery on unruptured asymptomatic cerebral aneurysms are still unclear. In this report, the authors use mathematical methods to attempt to quantify the benefit of surgery for unruptured aneurysms. Theoretical survival curves for either operative or conservative treatment were obtained by solving differential equations on the survival rate of a patient harboring an unruptured aneurysm. Patients' life expectancies were calculated as areas under these curves, and operative benefit was quantified as a gain in average life expectancy. To analyze morbidity, two concepts were introduced: premorbid survival rate and average premorbid survival period, and the operative gain of average premorbid survival period was calculated under certain assumptions. Larger operative benefit was observed in younger patients, with increasingly less benefit in the elderly. The operative gain of average life expectancy was 3.9 years for a 40-year-old patient, 2.4 years for 50, 1.3 years for 60, and 0.6 years for a 70-year-old. Quantified operative benefit is presented in a table for various patient ages, yearly rupture rates, and expected operative morbidity and mortality. This mathematical method would be useful to both surgeons and patients in making their decisions on surgery.},

METHODS: An electrical circuit model of CSF dynamics in the spine was used. With this model, the derangement of CSF dynamics in adhesive arachnoiditis was simulated. The effects of various surgical procedures were then analysed, such as syringo-subarachnoid shunting, subarachnoid bypass, and foramen magnum decompression. RESULTS: When CSF flow in the subarachnoid space was obstructed at a certain point, the pressure inside the spinal cord increased in the segment immediately distal to the blockage.

Syringo-subarachnoid shunting, subarachnoid bypass, and foramen magnum decompression were all effective at reducing this pressure gradient. CONCLUSIONS: Blockage of the spinal subarachnoid CSF pathway produces a relative increase in the pressure inside the spinal cord distal to the blockage point. Repetitive formation of this pressure gradient then induces CSF leakage into the spinal parenchyma, leading to the formation of syringomyelia.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk factors for unsatisfactory outcome. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There has been no detailed analysis of postoperative radicular pain, although it is not infrequent following foraminal and far lateral microdecompression. METHODS: A total of 184 patients, who were followed up for more than 2 years, were reviewed. Microdecompression was performed through lateral intermuscular approach. In cases of double herniation (combination of intracanalicular disc at the same level), additional intracanalicular decompression was simultaneously performed. The unsatisfactory outcomes included persistent or recurrent leg pain, based on the Japanese Orthopedic Association leg pain score, and revision surgery at the same level. The potential risk factors, including gender, age, symptom period, preoperative radiologic and intraoperative findings, were determined. RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 38.4 months, with a maximum 70 months. Forty of the 184 patients (21.7\%) had persistent or recurrent leg pain, with nine requiring revision surgeries. The statistically significant risk factor for unfavorable outcomes was double herniation, with odds ratio of 2.89 (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Facet preserving microdecompression is an effective method for foraminal and far lateral root compression. However, in cases of double herniation, total facetectomy is preferable.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Despite recent publications of large-scale study data, controversy over the management of unruptured cerebral aneurysms continues. The low rupture rates in the International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) apparently contradicted surgeons' experiences with ruptured aneurysms. In the present study, based on data from the ISUIA, a mathematical model describing the natural history of cerebral aneurysms was developed. With this model, the author aimed to examine the validity of data from the ISUIA and to provide a better treatment guideline for unruptured aneurysms. METHODS: The author made a computer simulation of the natural history of cerebral aneurysms that was used to calculate such figures as the prevalence of unruptured aneurysms, incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and age and size distribution of both unruptured and ruptured aneurysms. The lifetime lesion rupture probability for individual patients with various ages and aneurysm sizes was also computed, thereby providing a useful index to help patients in the medical decision-making process. The computer model produced a sample of unruptured aneurysms in the general population with a prevalence of 4.2\% and a median diameter of 5.8 mm. These unruptured aneurysms--affected by the rupture rate reported in the ISUIA--had a yearly SAH incidence of 19.6 per 100,000 persons. The median diameter of these aneurysms was 9.4 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in the present study validated the results of the ISUIA by showing that the seemingly low rupture rates could explain the statistical data for ruptured aneurysms. With the featured model, the author calculated the lifetime probability of lesion rupture--a useful measure for deciding on the optimal treatment for unruptured aneurysms.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the surgical technique and results of microsurgical posterolateral transmuscular approach for lumbar foraminal stenosis. In addition, to evaluate the diagnostic ability of coronal thin-sliced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for this disease. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Lumbar foraminal stenosis is a disease caused by compression of the nerve root or dorsal root ganglion at the intervertebral foramen often causing severe sciatic pain. Although its diagnosis and surgical treatment has been described in the literature, posterolateral transmuscular approach has not been well described. In addition, definitive radiologic diagnosis of this disease is often difficult, which can lead to failed back syndrome. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 39 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for lumbar foraminal stenosis from 2004 to 2009. Special thin-sliced coronal MRI was used for preoperative evaluation. Microsurgical posterolateral transmuscular approach was used to decompress the intervertebral foramen from the lateral side preserving most of the pars interarticularis and facet joint. Contralateral medial approach was used for cases with associated central canal stenosis. Surgical results were scored using MacNab scale. We compared the sensitivity and specificity of 2 MRI signs: (1) abnormal course of the nerve root inside the foramen on coronal slices, and (2) obliteration of the foramen on sagittal slices, and statistically analyzed them with the {$\chi$} method. RESULTS: The MacNab score with the mean follow-up period of 25.5 months was excellent in 28 (72\%), good in 5 (13\%), fair in 3 (8\%), and poor in 3 (8\%) patients. There was no grave complication. Coronal MRI sign showed significantly better sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Posterolateral transmuscular approach with microsurgical foraminotomy provided excellent surgical results. Coronal thin-sliced MRI can be useful for diagnosis of this disease.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective subcohort study. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether preoperative presence of degenerative spondylolisthesis worsens the outcome of patients undergoing unilateral laminotomy with bilateral decompression for lumbar stenosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The standard surgical treatment for degenerative spondylolisthesis with lumbar stenosis is lumbar fusion after standard laminectomy. Although this strategy is widely adopted, it is not supported by class I evidence. This strategy assumes that degenerative spondylolisthesis worsens the outcome of laminectomy by causing postoperative instability. However, instability may be reduced or prevented by the use of less invasive decompression techniques. METHODS: To test the hypothesis that preoperative degenerative spondylolisthesis worsens the outcome of less invasive lumbar decompression, we performed a prospective cohort study of 165 consecutive patients who underwent unilateral laminotomy with bilateral decompression at our institution. The patients were prospectively followed with a standardized questionnaire, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and standing lumbar radiographs for a maximum follow-up period of 5 years. According to the presence or absence of degenerative spondylolisthesis, the patients were divided into 2 groups: an olisthesis group and a nonolisthesis group. RESULTS: The average 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical score and bodily pain score improved substantially immediately after surgery. This improvement was maintained up to 5 years postoperatively. Progression of slippage was uncommon in both groups, with an overall incidence of 8\% at 5 years of follow-up. There was no significant difference in the average physical score, the bodily pain score, or the rate of progression of slippage between the olisthesis and nonolisthesis groups. CONCLUSION: Our study thus indicates that preoperative degenerative spondylolisthesis does not worsen the outcome of patients with lumbar stenosis undergoing unilateral laminotomy with bilateral decompression. These results suggest that lumbar fusion is often unnecessary in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis and lumbar stenosis if the posterior decompression technique is unilateral laminotomy with bilateral decompression.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The standard surgical treatment for degenerative spondylolisthesis with lumbar stenosis is lumbar fusion after standard laminectomy. Although this strategy is widely adopted, it is not supported by class I evidence. This strategy assumes that degenerative spondylolisthesis worsens the outcome of laminectomy by causing postoperative instability. However, instability may be reduced or prevented by the use of less invasive decompression techniques. METHODS: To test the hypothesis that preoperative degenerative spondylolisthesis worsens the outcome of less invasive lumbar decompression, we performed a prospective cohort study of 165 consecutive patients who underwent unilateral laminotomy with bilateral decompression at our institution. The patients were prospectively followed with a standardized questionnaire, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and standing lumbar radiographs for a maximum follow-up period of 5 years. According to the presence or absence of degenerative spondylolisthesis, the patients were divided into 2 groups: an olisthesis group and a nonolisthesis group. RESULTS: The average 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical score and bodily pain score improved substantially immediately after surgery. This improvement was maintained up to 5 years postoperatively. Progression of slippage was uncommon in both groups, with an overall incidence of 8\% at 5 years of follow-up. There was no significant difference in the average physical score, the bodily pain score, or the rate of progression of slippage between the olisthesis and nonolisthesis groups. CONCLUSION: Our study thus indicates that preoperative degenerative spondylolisthesis does not worsen the outcome of patients with lumbar stenosis undergoing unilateral laminotomy with bilateral decompression. These results suggest that lumbar fusion is often unnecessary in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis and lumbar stenosis if the posterior decompression technique is unilateral laminotomy with bilateral decompression.

  abstract = {An arachnoid web is an abnormal formation of the arachnoid membrane in the spinal subarachnoid space that blocks CSF flow and causes syringomyelia. Although the precise mechanism of syrinx formation is unknown, dissection of the arachnoid web shrinks the syrinx and improves symptoms. Precisely determining the location of the arachnoid web is difficult preoperatively, however, because the fine structure generally cannot be visualized in usual MRI sequences. In this report the authors describe 2 cases of arachnoid web in which the web was preoperatively identified using quantitative CSF flow analysis of MRI. By analyzing cardiac-gated phase-contrast cine-mode MRI in multiple axial planes, the authors precisely localized the obstruction of CSF flow on the dorsal side of the spinal cord in both patients. This technique also revealed a 1-way valve-like function of the arachnoid webs. Imaging led to the early diagnosis of myelopathy related to the derangement of CSF flow and allowed the authors to successfully excise the webs through limited surgical exposure.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To describe a newly found increased flow signal in phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging observed in compressed segments of the spinal cord in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Derangement of cerebrospinal fluid movement in the spine is a well-known cause of syringomyelia. However, its possible role in CSM has not been studied well, despite the fact that similar derangement takes place in CSM. METHODS: In a consecutive series of 57 patients with CSM, cardiac-gated phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging was analyzed. The amplitude of the flow signal obtained in the compressed segment of the spinal cord was compared with that obtained in the lesion-free C2 segment. It was also compared with controls obtained from 10 healthy volunteers. We also studied whether the amplitude was correlated with the severity of cervical canal stenosis, neurological symptoms, indication of surgery, and the presence of intramedullary high-intensity signal on T2-weighted images. In 33 patients who underwent decompression surgical procedures, we compared the amplitude of the flow signal between the preoperative and the postoperative study. RESULTS: Increased flow signal on phase-contrast study was seen in compressed segments of the spinal cord in 36 (63\%) patients. The mean amplitude of the signal in the compressed segment was 0.64 {$\pm$} 0.06 cm/s, whereas that in the C2 segment was 0.27 {$\pm$} 0.01 and that in the controls was 0.28 {$\pm$} 0.01. The flow signal linearly increased as the severity of canal stenosis increased. It significantly correlated with the symptom of upper-extremity dysesthesia, and the indication of surgery in these patients. The mean amplitude of the signal tended to be higher in those with intramedullary high-intensity signal than in those without. After decompression surgery, the increased flow signal was markedly diminished, and returned to a level comparable with the controls. CONCLUSION: Phase-contrast imaging demonstrated increased flow signal in compressed segments of the spinal cord in a majority of patients with CSM. This suggests a possible role played by derangement of cerebrospinal fluid movement in CSM. It also suggests potential usefulness of phase-contrast study in the management of patients with CSM.

However, the superiority of this strategy has not been irrefutably proved. Considering the risk associated with the instrumentation surgery, examining a less invasive approach is justified. METHODS: We describe a series of 9 patients with adult isthmic spondylolisthesis, in whom we microsurgically decompressed the responsible nerve root in the intervertebral foramen through the posterolateral intermuscular approach. Technical details specific to isthmic spondylolisthesis were reviewed. The 2-year outcome was assessed with Short Form 36 and visual analog scale scores. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 68 {$\pm$} 7 years (standard deviation [SD]). The mean slip rate of spondylolisthesis measured on the preoperative lumbar radiography was 20\% {$\pm$} 12\% (SD). All patients successfully underwent the procedure without complications. All the examined scores remained significantly better than the preoperative values 2 years after surgery; the mean visual analog scale score decreased from 7.8 {$\pm$} 2.8 (SD) preoperatively to 2.8 {$\pm$} 1.4 (SD) at 2 years (P~= 0.008), average physical score of Short Form 36 improved from 33.1 {$\pm$} 9.7 to 52.5 {$\pm$} 9.4 (P~= 0.001), and the bodily pain score improved from 28.0 {$\pm$} 13.5 to 55.1 {$\pm$} 9.7 (P~= 0.001).

However, lateral approaches to the spine are usually more technically demanding and require certain amount of surgical expertise. In this report, we describe a simple and easy technique to obtain the lateral viewing angle to the ventral spinal pathology. CASE DESCRIPTION: The technique is demonstrated in a ventrally located meningioma at C2 level. Axial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a square posterior shift of the spinal cord with little lateral space, which necessitated a more lateral viewing angle than the conventional posterior approach. With the patient in a prone position, we made a horizontal skin incision at the level of C2 and unilaterally exposed the right side of the C1 and C2 laminae. We then made a small perpendicular incision on the medial portion of the paravertebral muscles, which we retracted longitudinally. This approach provided an unobstructed lateral view toward the spinal cord. Following a gross total removal of the tumor with minimal cord retraction, the patient made an uneventful recovery. Her preoperative neurological symptoms completely resolved in two months. No significant muscle atrophy was observed on postoperative MRI at three months. There was no long-term complication related to the muscle incision at one-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: The posterior paramedian approach is a simple and versatile technique to obtain lateral viewing angle to the spine and useful for approaching lesions residing ventral to the spinal cord.},

To investigate the hypothesis that sagittal spinal balance also plays a role in decompression surgery for lumbar canal stenosis, a prospective cohort study analyzing the correlation between preoperative lumbar lordosis and outcome was performed. METHODS: A cohort of 85 consecutive patients who underwent decompression for lumbar canal stenosis during the period 2007-2011 was analyzed. Standing lumbar x-rays and 36-item short form health survey questionnaires were obtained before and up to 2 years after surgery. Correlations between lumbar lordosis and 2 parameters of the 36-item short form health survey~(average physical score and bodily pain score) were statistically analyzed using linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between preoperative lumbar lordosis and the 2 outcome parameters at postoperative, 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year time~points. A~10\textdegree{} increase of lumbar lordosis was associated with a 5-point improvement in average physical scores. This correlation was not present in preoperative scores.

Placing them too medially results in suboptimal canal expansion, and placing them too laterally results in facet joint violation. However, precise placement is often difficult. METHODS: We have included a simple procedure called probe laminotomy in cervical expansive laminoplasty since 2013. This technique consisted of identifying the location of the pedicles through a small laminotomy with medial facetectomy before making lateral gutters. A case-control study was performed to compare the achieved postoperative canal area and duration of surgery between the original technique and the added probe laminotomy. RESULTS: The postoperative canal area was 21\% larger in the probe laminotomy group compared with the standard technique group (P~= 0.0003). There was no significant difference in duration of surgery between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: This technique facilitated more precise placement of the lateral gutter in cervical expansive laminoplasty, which resulted in a larger postoperative canal. This technique should be considered as an option in cervical expansive laminoplasty.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dumbbell-shaped spinal schwannomas with intradural and extradural components are associated with higher complication rates. This may be in part due to epineurial dissection of the extradural component, which inevitably damages the functioning nerve fibers beneath the epineurium and may lead to dural defects that are often difficult to repair. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to describe a radical intracapsular dissection technique that provides a simpler operative field with no need for dural repair and a better chance of preserving functioning nerve fibers. METHODS: The technique comprised the following: 1) exposure of the tumor while preserving spinal stability; 2) a single incision encompassing the dura and epineurium; 3) microsurgical dissection of the tumor just beneath the epineurium, preserving the viable nerve fibers; and 4) primary closure of the duroepineurial incision. We describe a case series of 7 patients in whom this type of tumor was excised using this technique. RESULTS: Gross total excision was achieved in 5 patients. In 1 patient with a large paravertebral component, the remaining tumor was removed with an additional anterior approach. No cerebrospinal fluid leak was noted, and no recurrence was observed in the median follow-up period of 36 months. CONCLUSIONS: The radical intracapsular dissection technique described herein represents an alternative technique for the removal of dumbbell-shaped spinal schwannomas with intradural and extradural components.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite a number of hypotheses, our understanding of the pathophysiology of syringomyelia is still limited. The current prevailing hypothesis assumes that the piston-like movement of the cerebellar tonsils drives the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the syrinx through the spinal perivascular space. However, it still needs to be verified by further experimental data. A major unexplained problem is how CSF enters and remains in the syrinx that has a higher pressure than the subarachnoid space. Methods: I analyzed phase-contrast MRI scans of 18 patients with Chiari-I malformation with syringomyelia undergoing foramen magnum decompression and 21 healthy volunteers. I analyzed the velocity waveforms of the CSF and the brain in various locations. The obtained velocity waveforms were post-processed using a technique called synchronization in situ . I compared between the preoperative data and the control data (case-control study), as well as between the preoperative and postoperative data (cohort study). Results: The syrinx shrank in 17 (94\%) patients with good clinical improvement. In Chiari-I patients, the velocity of the tonsil was significantly larger than controls, but was significantly smaller than that of the CSF in the subarachnoid space, suggesting passive rather than active movement. The abnormal tonsillar movement disappeared after surgery, but the velocity waveform of the spinal subarachnoid CSF did not change. These results, contradicting the above mentioned hypothesis, required an alternative explanation. I thus hypothesized that there is a CSF channel between the fourth ventricle and the syrinx. This channel assumes one-way valve function when mildly compressed by the cyclical movement of the cerebellar tonsil. The decompression of the tonsils switches off the one-way valve, collapsing the syrinx. Conclusions: My hypothesis reasonably explained my data that clearly contradicted the existing hypothesis, and successfully addressed the above-mentioned theoretical problem. It will serve as a working hypothesis for further study of syringomyelia pathophysiology.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional study. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine which radiographic parameters drive patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in primary presentation adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis (ASLS). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous literature suggests correlations between PROs and sagittal plane deformity (sagittal vertical axis [SVA], pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis [PI-LL] mismatch, pelvic tilt [PT]). Prior work included revision and primary adult spinal deformity patients. The present study addresses only primary presentation ASLS. METHODS: Prospective baseline data were analyzed on 286 patients enrolled in an NIH RO1 clinical trial by nine centers from 2010 to 2014. INCLUSION CRITERIA: 40 to 80 years old, lumbar Cobb (LC) 30\textdegree{} or higher and Scoliosis Research Society-23 score 4.0 or less in Pain, Function or Self-Image domains, or Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) 20 or higher. Patients were primary presentation (no prior spinal deformity surgery) and had complete baseline data: standing coronal/sagittal 36" radiographs and PROs (ODI, Scoliosis Research Society-23, Short Form-12). Correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate relations between radiographic parameters and PROs for the study population and a subset of patients with ODI 40 or higher. Analysis of variance was used to identify differences in PROs for radiographic modifier groups. RESULTS: Mean age was 60.3 years. Mean spinopelvic parameters were: LL{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}-39.2\textdegree; SVA{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}3.1 cm; sacral slope{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}32.5\textdegree; PT{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}23.9\textdegree; PI-LL mismatch{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}16.8\textdegree. Only weak correlations (0.2-0.4) were identified between population sacral slope, SVA and SVA modifiers, and SRS function. SVA and SVA modifiers were weakly associated with ODI. Although there were more correlations in subset analysis of high-symptom patients, all were weak. Analysis of variance identified significant differences in ODI reported by SVA modifier groups. CONCLUSION: In primary presentation patients with ASLS and a subset of "high-symptom" patients (ODI{$\mkern1mu\geq\mkern1mu$}40), only weak associations between baseline PROs and radiographic parameters were identified. For this patient population, these results suggest regional radiographic parameters (LC, LL, PT, PI-LL mismatch) are not drivers of PROs and cannot be used to extrapolate effect on patient-perceived pathology.

  abstract = {In the conventional posterior approach to the lumbar spine, the lamina is exposed by stripping the paravertebral muscles from the spinous process, and the resulting paravertebral muscle damage can produce muscle atrophy and decreased muscle strength. The author developed a novel surgical approach to the lumbar spine in which the attachment of the paravertebral muscles to the spinous process is preserved. In the novel approach, the spinous process is split on the midline without stripping the attached muscles, and a hemilateral half of the spinous process is then resected at the base, exposing only the ipsilateral lamina. Before closing, the resected half is sutured and reattached to the remaining half of the spinous process. Thirty-eight patients with lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSCS) undergoing unilateral partial laminectomy and bilateral decompression using this novel approach were analyzed. Postoperative changes in the multifidus muscle were evaluated by T2 signal intensity on MR images. MRI performed 1 year after the operation revealed no significant difference in the T2 signal intensity of the multifidus muscle between the approach and nonapproach sides. This result indicated that postoperative changes of the multifidus muscle on the approach side were slight. The clinical outcomes of unilateral partial laminectomy and bilateral decompression using this approach for LSCS were satisfactory. The novel approach can be a useful alternative to the conventional posterior lumbar approach.},

RESULTS: Of 93 total patients, the RNR group (n=37, 21/37 female) and non-RNR group (n=56; 31/56 female) had similar preoperative conditions (JOA score) and were not significantly different in age (mean 64.19{$\pm$}8.25 vs. 62.8{$\pm$}9.41 years), symptom duration (30.92{$\pm$}22.43 vs. 28.64{$\pm$}17.40 months), or follow-up periods (17.35{$\pm$}4.02 vs. 17.75{$\pm$}4.29mo) (all p{$>$}0.4). The non-RNR group exhibited significantly better final JOA score (p=0.015) and recovery rate (p=0.002). RNR group patients exhibited larger lumbar lordosis angles in the neutral position (p=0.009) and extension (p=0.021) and larger range of motion (p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Poorer surgical outcomes in patients with RNRs indicated that elevated lumbar lordosis angle and range of motion increased risks of RNR formation, which in turn may cause poorer post-surgical recovery, this information is possibly useful in prognostic assessment of lumbar stenosis complicated by RNRs.},

OBJECTIVE: To understand the effects of untethering on coronal spine balance for these patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In patients with tight filum terminale, the spinal cord is tethered by a thickened filum with a low conus medullaris but without other forms of spinal dysraphism. There have not been studies examining the effects of spinal cord untethering on coronal spinal alignment in children with tight filum terminale. METHODS: Forty-five consecutive pediatric patients with tight filum terminale who had undergone untethering were evaluated. Their presenting signs and symptoms, pre- and postsurgery imagings, and clinical courses were reviewed for scoliosis progression. RESULTS: Twenty-six girls and 19 boys underwent tethered cord release at a mean age of 4.5 years. The prevalence of coronal spinal malalignment, manifesting as scoliosis, before the untethering procedure was 31\% (14 of 45). During the follow-up period, nine patients had coronal spinal alignment that worsened{$>$}10\textdegree{} (five patients eventually underwent surgical fusion), two patients had spinal alignment that improved, and five patients' curves stabilized after untethering surgery. Therefore, at the end of the follow-up period, 9 of 45 patients (20\%) had worsened coronal spinal alignment. In the multivariate analysis, patients who presented with a Cobb angle greater than 35\textdegree{} were most likely to progress (P=0.002, odds ratio=21). There was no operative morbidity or mortality associated with scoliosis surgery. CONCLUSION: A significant number of children with tight filum terminale were found to present with scoliosis. In patients with less severe curves, tethered cord release may halt scoliosis progression.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To date, no pathophysiological model has sufficiently accounted for all the findings encountered in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Intracranial elastance is an index of volume-buffering capacity known to play a role in certain disorders of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, which has not been previously investigated in relation to IIH patients. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study from 1 July 2011 to 1 July 2016. Values for opening pressure (PO ), closing pressure (PC ) and volume (V) of CSF removed were collected, as well as demographic and clinical covariates. Intracranial elastance (E) and pressure-volume index (PVI) were calculated according to established equations: E = (PO -PC )/V and PVI = V/log10 (PO /PC ), respectively. Those with an alternative central nervous system pathology, including meningitis, encephalitis and normal pressure hydrocephalus were excluded. Eligible patients were subdivided into two groups based on final diagnosis: a control group and an IIH group. RESULTS: In our cohort (n = 49), a significant association of both E (P {$<$} 0.0001) and PVI (P = 0.005) with a diagnosis of IIH was observed. Median E was 0.45 [interquartile range (IQR) 0.29-0.63] in the control group and 1 (IQR 0.59-1.29) in the IIH group, and median PVI was 98.07 (IQR 59.92-135.86) in the control group and 64.1 (IQR 42.4-91.7) in the IIH group. Neither E nor PVI were significantly associated with age, gender or body mass index. PVI was independent of opening pressure. CONCLUSIONS: As calculated by clinically accessible indices, our study provides evidence that intracranial elastance is increased in IIH, reflecting a novel insight into disease pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The apparent paradox of natural history data suggesting low rupture risk of small asymptomatic aneurysms and the median size of aneurysm rupture remains unexplained. Aneurysm growth rates and their potential relationship with rupture risk have not been well examined in natural history studies. OBJECTIVE: To examine the question of whether small asymptomatic aneurysms {$\leq$} 7 mm that are followed up over time rupture and to determine the relationship between aneurysm growth and rupture. METHODS: We reviewed all publications on unruptured aneurysms published from 1966 to 2009. We then selected all aneurysms {$\leq$} 7 mm for which measurements were reported for at least 2 time points and for which initial asymptomatic status and ultimate outcome (rupture vs unruptured) were reported. Using the Mann-Whitney U test, we compared absolute diameter annual growth rate. RESULTS: Our search retrieved 64 aneurysms. Thirty aneurysms ruptured during follow-up, of which 27 were enlarged before rupture (90\%). Thirty-four aneurysms did not rupture, of which 24 enlarged during follow-up (71\%). There was a statistically significant trend toward larger absolute diameter growth for ruptured aneurysms vs unruptured aneurysms (3.89 {$\pm$} 2.34 vs 1.79 {$\pm$} 1.02 mm; P {$<$} .001), respectively. Annual growth rates for aneurysms for the 2 groups, however, were not statistically different (27.46 {$\pm$} 18.76 vs 32.00 {$\pm$} 29.30; P = .92). CONCLUSION: Small aneurysms are prone to growth and rupture. Aneurysm rupture is more likely to occur in aneurysms with larger absolute diameter growth, but rupture can also occur in the absence of growth. The annual growth rate in both groups suggests that rate of growth of aneurysms is highly variable and unpredictable, justifying treatment or close diagnostic follow-up.},

OBJECTIVES: To assess complications after posterior fusion and instrumentation for degenerative lumbar scoliosis, to determine risk factors of complications, and to analyze the clinical outcomes of surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The complications after degenerative lumbar scoliosis surgery have reported to be high. Risk factors for developing complications are unknown. METHODS: Forty-seven patients (average age, 66.6 years; range, 48-83 years) with degenerative lumbar scoliosis undergoing posterior fusion and instrumentation were analyzed. Seven patients had additional posterior lumbar interbody fusion at the lumbosacral junction. The average number of levels fused was 4.7 +/- 2.2 segments. We evaluated the early perioperative ({$<$}3 months after surgery) and late complications. RESULTS: There were 14 early perioperative complications and 18 late complications. There was 1 case of mortality by pulmonary embolism. Early complications included ileus, urinary tract infection, transient delirium, superficial infection, and neurologic deficit. Late complications included adjacent segment diseases, pseudarthrosis, and loosening of screws. Adjacent segment disease developed at the proximal segment in 10 patients and at the distal segment in 5 patients. Pseudarthrosis was noted at the lumbosacral junction in 2 patients. Revision surgery was performed in 7 patients. Older patients ({$>$}65 years) had the tendency to increase early complications without statistical difference (P = 0.053). Excessive intraoperative blood loss was the most significant risk factor for the development of early perioperative complications, and number of levels fused was related to blood loss. Operative time and multiple medical comorbidities were not associated with higher complication rate. There were no specific factors related to the development of late complications. CONCLUSION: The complication rate after posterior fusion and instrumentation for degenerative lumbar scoliosis was 68\%. Abundant blood loss was a significant risk factor for early perioperative complications. The improvement of Oswestry disability index was less in patients with late complications.},

  abstract = {The extent of fusion for degenerative lumbar scoliosis has not yet been determined. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of short fusion versus long fusion for degenerative lumbar scoliosis. Fifty patients (mean age 65.5 +/- 5.1 years) undergoing decompression and fusion with pedicle screw instrumentation were evaluated. Short fusion was defined as fusion within the deformity, not exceeding the end vertebra. Long fusion was defined as fusion extended above the upper end vertebra. The lower end vertebra was included in the fusion in all the patients. The short fusion group included 28 patients and the long fusion group included 22 patients. Patients' age and number of medical co-morbidities were similar in both the groups. The number of levels fused was 3.1 +/- 0.9 segments in the short fusion group and 6.5 +/- 1.5 in the long fusion group. Before surgery, the average Cobb angle was 16.3 degrees (range 11-28 degrees ) in the short fusion group and 21.7 degrees (range 12-33 degrees ) in the long fusion group. The correction of the Cobb angle averaged 39\% in the short fusion group and 72\% in the long fusion group with a statistical difference (P = 0.001). Coronal imbalance improved significantly in the long fusion group more than in the short fusion group (P = 0.03). The correction of lateral listhesis was better in the long fusion group (P = 0.02). However, there was no difference in the correction of lumbar lordosis and sagittal imbalance between the two groups. Ten of the 50 patients had additional posterolateral lumbar interbody fusion at L4-5 or L5-S1. The interbody fusion had a positive influence in improving lumbar lordosis, but was ineffective at restoring sagittal imbalance. Early perioperative complications were likely to develop in the long fusion group. Late complications included adjacent segment disease, loosening of screws, and pseudarthrosis. Adjacent segment disease developed in ten patients in the short fusion group, and in five patients in the long fusion group. In the short fusion group, adjacent segment disease occurred proximally in all of the ten patients. Loosening of distal screws developed in three patients, and pseudarthrosis at L5-S1 in one patient in the long fusion group. Reoperation was performed in four patients in the long fusion group and three patients in the short fusion group. In conclusion, short fusion is sufficient for patients with small Cobb angle and good spinal balance. For patients with severe Cobb angle and rotatory subluxation, long fusion should be carried out to minimize adjacent segment disease. For patients who have severe sagittal imbalance, spinal osteotomy is an alternative technique to be considered. As long fusion is likely to increase early perioperative complications, great care should be taken for high-risk patients to avoid complications.},

  abstract = {The rapid increase of elderly population has resulted in increased prevalence of adult scoliosis. Adult scoliosis is divided into adult idiopathic scoliosis and adult degenerative scoliosis. These two types of scoliosis vary in patient age, curve pattern and clinical symptoms, which necessitate different surgical indications and options. Back pain and deformity are major indications for surgery in adult idiopathic scoliosis, whereas radiating pain to the legs due to foraminal stenosis is what often requires surgery in adult degenerative scoliosis. When selecting a surgical method, major symptoms and underlying medical diseases should be carefully evaluated, not only to relieve symptoms but also to minimize postoperative complications. Surgical options for adult degenerative scoliosis include: decompression alone; decompression and limited short fusion; and decompression coupled with long fusion and correction of deformity. Decompression and limited short fusion can be applied to patients with a small Cobb's angle and normal sagittal imbalance. For those with a large Cobb's angle and positive sagittal imbalance, long fusion with correction of deformity is required. When long fusion is applied, a careful decision regarding the extent of fusion level should be made when selecting L5 or S1 as the distal fusion level and T10 or the thoracolumbar junction as the proximal fusion level. For the fusion extending to the sacrum, restoration of sagittal balance and rigid fixation with additional iliac screws should be considered. Any surgical procedures for adult degenerative scoliosis are known to have relatively high occurrences of complications; therefore, risks and benefits should be meticulously considered before selecting a surgical procedure.},

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the long-term effect of supplementary transpedicular screw fixation on reoperation rate and functional outcome. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Within the past few years the benefit of supplemental pedicle screw fixation has been questioned as a standard procedure in lumbar spinal fusion surgery. The long-term effect of supplemental pedicle screw fixation is still unknown. METHODS: From 1992 through 1994 a total of 129 patients with severe chronic low back pain were randomly selected for either supplemental pedicle screw fixation (instrumented) or no pedicle screw instrumentation (noninstrumented) posterolateral spinal fusion. The Dallas Pain Questionnaire, Low Back Pain Rating Scale, and a questionnaire concerning work status assessed the outcome. RESULTS: A 5-year follow-up of 93\% showed that the instrumented group had a 25\% reoperation rate (removal of instrumentation with and without second fusion) compared with a reoperation rate of 14\% in the noninstrumented group (fusion and decompression) (P {$<$} 0.03). A total of 51\% were capable of working after 5 years compared with 40\% before surgery. There was no difference in work capacity between the two groups at any point of observation. Overall, there was no significant difference between the instrumented and noninstrumented groups in regard to functional outcome as measured by both the Dallas Pain Questionnaire and Low Back Pain Rating Scale. When analyzing diagnostic subgroups at the 5-year follow-up, patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis had a significantly better outcome by use of a posterolateral fusion without supplemental instrumentation compared with an instrumented fusion (P {$<$} 0.03). However, patients with primary degenerative instability improved significantly more when instrumentation supported the posterolateral spinal fusions (P {$<$} 0.02). To the question "was it worth it?" 67\% answered "yes" in the instrumented group whereas 70\% did so in the noninstrumented groups (not significant). CONCLUSION: The long-term functional outcome of posterolateral spinal fusion improved significantly for boththose with and without pedicle screw instrumentation, with a global 70\% satisfaction reported by the patients. Patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis Grades 1 and 2 with noninstrumented fusion had superior long-term outcomes after posterolateral spinal fusion in comparison with an instrumented fusion. In contrast, patients diagnosed as having primary degenerative instability improved significantly when the posterolateral fusion was supported by instrumentation. In actuality, pedicle screw instrumentation increased reoperation rate compared with noninstrumented posterolateral fusion.},

Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age\,{$\leq$}65~years and (2) planned microsurgery or endovascular surgery for unruptured intracranial aneurysm. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) preoperative intelligence quotient\,{$<$}80 (n\,=\,3); (2) initial modified Rankin scale\,{$\geq$}1 (n\,=\,1); (3) loss to follow-up (n\,=\,1). An auditory controlled continuous performance test (ACCPT), word-color test (WCT) and verbal learning test (VLT) were performed before and after (6~months) preventive surgery. RESULTS: ACCPT (attention), WCT (executive function) and VLT (learning and memory) scores did not change significantly between the pre- and postoperative evaluations. The ACCPT, WCT, total VLT scores (verbal learning) and delayed VLT scores (memory) did not differ significantly between patients undergoing microsurgery and those undergoing endovascular surgery. However, ACCPT, WCT and delayed VLT scores decreased postoperatively in patients with leukoaraiosis on preoperative FLAIR images (OR 9.899, p\,=\,0.041; OR 11.421, p\,=\,0.006; OR 2.952, p\,=\,0.024, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Preventive surgery for unruptured intracranial aneurysms did not affect attention, executive function, learning or memory. However, patients with leukoaraiosis on FLAIR images might be prone to deficits in attention, executive function and memory postoperatively, whereas learning might not be affected.},

  abstract = {Diffusion MRI is extensively used to study brain microarchitecture and pathologies, and water diffusion appears highly anisotropic in the white matter (WM) of the spinal cord (SC). Despite these facts, the use of diffusion MRI to study the SC, which has increased in recent years, is much less common than that in the brain. In the present review, after a brief outline of early studies of diffusion MRI (DWI) and diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) of the SC, we provide a short survey on DTI and on diffusion MRI methods beyond the tensor that have been used to study SC microstructure and pathologies. After introducing the porous view of WM and describing the q-space approach and q-space diffusion MRI (QSI), we describe other methodologies that can be applied to study the SC. Selected applications of the use of DTI, QSI, and other more advanced diffusion MRI methods to study SC microstructure and pathologies are presented, with some emphasis on the use of less conventional diffusion methodologies. Because of length constraints, we concentrate on structural studies and on a few selected pathologies. Examples of the use of diffusion MRI to study dysmyelination, demyelination as in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and traumatic SC injury are presented. We conclude with a brief summary and a discussion of challenges and future directions for diffusion MRI of the SC. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We decided to limit the retrospective study to obtain at least 5 years of follow-up. Therefore, 20 additional neurinomas treated between 1997 and 2002 were excluded. METHODS: All the cases are evaluated under statistical, clinical, neuroradiological, and surgically technical profiles based on data from clinical records and from periodic check-ups after surgery. In particular, the results are analyzed on the basis of an accurate pre- and postsurgical evaluation using Karnofsky's scale and Kleklamp-Samii's scoring system. RESULTS: We treated 179 spinal neurinomas in 152 (93 male and 59 female) patients. The mean age was 44.3. In 33 cases the neurinoma was sited in the cervical tract, in 59 cases in the dorsal tract, and in 87 cases in the lumbo-sacral tract. Eleven patients harbored Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis (7 NF1 and 4 NF2 of which 1 was intramedullary). In 123 cases the neurinoma was intradural, in 11 cases it was extradural, in 2 intra/extradural, in 9 it had a dumbbell form, and in 2 cases it was intramedullary; the remaining cases had neurofibromatosis. The most common presurgical symptom was segmental pain. Total removal of the lesion was possible in the first operation for 174 neurinomas. We encountered 3 cases of malignant neurinoma of which 1 was in NF2. The result of surgery was recovery in 108 cases; 2 patients with NF2 died, and local recurrence occurred even after total exeresis (excision) and radiotherapy in the cases of malignant neurinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Schwannomas represent the most frequent tumor lesions of the spine with prevalence for the cervical-inferior tract and the dorso-lumbar passage. Intramedullary neurinomas are rarely observed. The total surgical removal of neurinomas is often an attainable goal, and clinical improvement is the common outcome with exception to malignant forms and NF2 neurofibromatosis.

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether financial relationships with industry had any impact on operative and/or complication rates of spine surgeons performing fusion surgeries. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Recent actions from Congress and the Institute of Medicine have highlighted the importance of conflicts of interest among physicians. Orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons have been identified as receiving the highest amount of industry payments among all specialties. No study has yet investigated the potential effects of disclosed industry payments with quality and choices of patient care. METHODS: A comprehensive database of spine surgeons in the United States with compiled data of industry payments, operative fusion rates, and complication rates was created. Practice pattern data were derived from a publicly available Medicare-based database generated from selected CPT codes from 2011 to 2012. Complication rate data from 2009 to 2013 were extracted from the ProPublica-Surgeon-Scorecard database, which utilizes postoperative inhospital mortality and 30-day-readmission for designated conditions as complications of surgery. Data regarding industry payments from 2013 to 2014 were derived from the Open Payments website. Surgeons performing {$<$}10 fusions, those without complication data, and those whose identity could not be verified through public records were excluded. Pearson correlation coefficients and multivariate regression analyses were used to determine the relationship between industry payments, operative fusion rate, and/or complication rate. RESULTS: A total of 2110 surgeons met the inclusion criteria for our database. The average operative fusion rate was 8.8\% (SD 4.8\%), whereas the average complication rate for lumbar and cervical fusion was 4.1\% and 1.9\%, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a statistically significant but negligible relationship between disclosed payments/transactions and both operative fusion and complication rates. CONCLUSION: Our findings do not support a strong correlation between the payments a surgeon receives from industry and their decisions to perform spine fusion or associated complication rates. Large variability in the rate of fusions performed suggests a poor consensus for indications for spine fusion surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Tight filum syndrome (TFS) is caused by a thick (abnormal T1 MRI), shortened (low-lying conus), or non-elastic filum (strictly normal MRI). We carefully analyzed children treated for suspect TFS with or without radiological abnormalities. METHODS: Twenty-five children, operated between 2002 and 2009, were retrospectively identified. All children had been evaluated by a multidisciplinary team preoperatively. Symptoms, signs and diagnostic test results were categorized (neurologic, urologic, orthopedic, dermatologic) and compared pre- and one year postoperatively. Normal MR was defined as conus medullaris (CM) at or above mid-body L2 and filum diameter less than 2 mm. Occult TFS (OTFS) was defined as TFS with normal MR. RESULTS: DEMOGRAPHICS: 17 girls, 8 boys, age 2-18 years, including 11 syndromal children. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: all children had problems in the neurologic category and at least one other category: urologic (n = 17), orthopedic (n = 21), and dermatologic (n = 11). MR findings: low-lying CM (n = 14) including 2 with thick filum, normal CM but fatty filum (n = 2), strictly normal (n = 9). Clinical outcome one year postoperatively: neurologic 20 improved, 5 stabilized; urologic 13 improved, 3 stabilized, 1 worsened; orthopedic (8 children presenting with scoliosis) 3 improved, 4 stabilized, 1 worsened. All children with OTFS (n = 9) improved in at least one and 8 improved in all affected categories. CONCLUSIONS: Children with strong clinical suspicion for TFS ({$\geq$} 2 affected categories) with or without abnormal MR findings will likely benefit from surgery. In such cases we suggest a detailed full spine MR, a multidisciplinary diagnostic work-up, and eventual untethering through an interlaminar microsurgical approach.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Several reports suggest that spine surgery has experienced rapid growth in the past decade. Limited data exist, however, documenting the increase in spinal fusion. The objective of this work was to quantify and characterize the contemporary practice of spinal fusion in the United States. METHODS: Clinical data were obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for the years from 1993 to 2003. All patients with International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedure codes indicating cervical fusion, thoracolumbar fusion, lumbar or unspecified fusion were identified (n = 471,990). Primary ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes were used to determine the rationale for surgical fusion. Population-based utilization rates overall and for each procedure were calculated from United States census data. Rank order of spinal fusion compared with other inpatient procedures from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample was reported for the years 1997 to 2003. RESULTS: Overall utilization increased during the time period for cervical, thoracolumbar, and lumbar fusions by 89, 31, and 134\%, respectively. Patients aged 40 to 59 years experienced the rapid rise in utilization for cervical fusions (60-110 per 100,000) and lumbar fusions (35-84 per 100,000). For patients 60 years and older, utilization also increased for cervical (30-67 per 100,000), thoracolumbar (4-9 per 100,000), and lumbar (42-108 per 100,000). Spinal fusion rose from the 41st most common inpatient procedure in 1997 to the 19th in 2003. CONCLUSION: Cervical, thoracolumbar, and lumbar spinal fusion have experienced a rapid increase in utilization in isolation and compared with other surgical procedures in contemporary practice. These changes are most pronounced for patients over 40 years of age, and degenerative disc disease seems to account for much of this increase.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Historically, adult degenerative lumbar scoliosis (DLS) has been treated with multilevel decompression and instrumented fusion to reduce neural compression and stabilize the spinal column. However, due to the profound morbidity associated with complex multilevel surgery, particularly in elderly patients and those with multiple medical comorbidities, minimally invasive surgical approaches have been proposed. The goal of this meta-analysis was to review the differences in patient selection for minimally invasive surgical versus open surgical procedures for adult DLS, and to compare the postoperative outcomes following minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and open surgery. METHODS: In this meta-analysis the authors analyzed the complication rates and the clinical outcomes for patients with adult DLS undergoing complex decompressive procedures with fusion versus minimally invasive surgical approaches. Minimally invasive surgical approaches included decompressive laminectomy, microscopic decompression, lateral and extreme lateral interbody fusion (XLIF), and percutaneous pedicle screw placement for fusion. Mean patient age, complication rates, reoperation rates, Cobb angle, and measures of sagittal balance were investigated and compared between groups. RESULTS: Twelve studies were identified for comparison in the MIS group, with 8 studies describing the lateral interbody fusion or XLIF and 4 studies describing decompression without fusion. In the decompression MIS group, the mean preoperative Cobb angle was 16.7\textdegree{} and mean postoperative Cobb angle was 18\textdegree. In the XLIF group, mean pre- and postoperative Cobb angles were 22.3\textdegree{} and 9.2\textdegree, respectively. The difference in postoperative Cobb angle was statistically significant between groups on 1-way ANOVA (p = 0.014). Mean preoperative Cobb angle, mean patient age, and complication rate did not differ between the XLIF and decompression groups. Thirty-five studies were identified for inclusion in the open surgery group, with 18 studies describing patients with open fusion without osteotomy and 17 papers detailing outcomes after open fusion with osteotomy. Mean preoperative curve in the open fusion without osteotomy and with osteotomy groups was 41.3\textdegree{} and 32\textdegree, respectively. Mean reoperation rate was significantly higher in the osteotomy group (p = 0.008). On 1-way ANOVA comparing all groups, there was a statistically significant difference in mean age (p = 0.004) and mean preoperative curve (p = 0.002). There was no statistically significant difference in complication rates between groups (p = 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that surgeons are offering patients open surgery or MIS depending on their age and the severity of their deformity. Greater sagittal and coronal correction was noted in the XLIF versus decompression only MIS groups. Larger Cobb angles, greater sagittal imbalance, and higher reoperation rates were found in studies reporting the use of open fusion with osteotomy. Although complication rates did not significantly differ between groups, these data are difficult to interpret given the heterogeneity in reporting complications between studies.},

  abstract = {Importance: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a highly disabling but often misdiagnosed disorder. The best management options for patients with SIH are still uncertain. Objective: To provide an objective summary of the available evidence on the clinical presentation, investigations findings, and treatment outcomes for SIH. Data Sources: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on SIH. Three databases were searched from inception to April 30, 2020: PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane. The following search terms were used in each database: spontaneous intracranial hypotension, low CSF syndrome, low CSF pressure syndrome, low CSF volume syndrome, intracranial hypotension, low CSF pressure, low CSF volume, CSF hypovolemia, CSF hypovolaemia, spontaneous spinal CSF leak, spinal CSF leak, and CSF leak syndrome. Study Selection: Original studies in English language reporting 10 or more patients with SIH were selected by consensus. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data on clinical presentation, investigations findings, and treatment outcomes were collected and summarized by multiple observers. Random-effect meta-analyses were used to calculate pooled estimates of means and proportions. Main Outcomes and Measures: The predetermined main outcomes were the pooled estimate proportions of symptoms of SIH, imaging findings (brain and spinal imaging), and treatment outcomes (conservative, epidural blood patches, and surgical). Results: Of 6878 articles, 144 met the selection criteria and reported on average 53 patients with SIH each (range, 10-568 patients). The most common symptoms were orthostatic headache (92\% [95\% CI, 87\%-96\%]), nausea (54\% [95\% CI, 46\%-62\%]), and neck pain/stiffness (43\% [95\% CI, 32\%-53\%]). Brain magnetic resonance imaging was the most sensitive investigation, with diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement identified in 73\% (95\% CI, 67\%-80\%) of patients. Brain magnetic resonance imaging findings were normal in 19\% (95\% CI, 13\%-24\%) of patients. Spinal neuroimaging identified extradural cerebrospinal fluid in 48\% to 76\% of patients. Digital subtraction myelography and magnetic resonance myelography with intrathecal gadolinium had high sensitivity in identifying the exact leak site. Lumbar puncture opening pressures were low, normal (60-200 mm H2O), and high in 67\% (95\% CI, 54\%-80\%), 32\% (95\% CI, 20\%-44\%), and 3\% (95\% CI, 1\%-6\%), respectively. Conservative treatment was effective in 28\% (95\% CI, 18\%-37\%) of patients and a single epidural blood patch was successful in 64\% (95\% CI, 56\%-72\%). Large epidural blood patches ({$>$}20 mL) had better success rates than small epidural blood patches (77\% [95\% CI, 63\%-91\%] and 66\% [95\% CI, 55\%-77\%], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension should not be excluded on the basis of a nonorthostatic headache, normal neuroimaging findings, or normal lumbar puncture opening pressure. Despite the heterogeneous nature of the studies available in the literature and the lack of controlled interventional studies, this systematic review offers a comprehensive and objective summary of the evidence on SIH that could be useful in guiding clinical practice and future research.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schwannoma is the most common tumor of the peripheral nerves, with surgical enucleation being the established treatment modality. However, some schwannomas cannot be easily enucleated and this sometimes results in iatrogenic nerve injury even with atraumatic procedures. Here we present a retrospective review of the management of schwannoma in the extremities and compare clinical outcomes from the two techniques of extra-capsular and intra-capsular enucleation. METHODS: We reviewed 36 schwannomas from 35 patients who underwent surgical excision of schwannomas arising from the extremities. Twenty had undergone extra-capsular resection and 16 had undergone enucleation using the intra-capsular technique. The post-operative neurological deficits were graded as minor, major, and transient. The duration of symptoms, maximum tumor diameter and site of occurrence were compared between patients with the three grades of deficit. RESULTS: In total, 22 patients developed no sensory changes following enucleation of schwannoma or only temporary and minor changes that had fully resolved within 6 months. Ten patients developed new neurological deficits following surgery that took longer than 6 months to resolve. Four patients experienced new motor deficits or paresthesia following operation that had still not recovered at the final follow-up, all of whom underwent enucleation using the extra-capsular technique. Neurological deficit after enucleation was significantly lower using the intra-capsular compared with the extra-capsular technique. Patient age, duration of symptoms, maximum diameter of the tumor and site of occurrence did not influence the neurological deficit following enucleation of schwannoma. CONCLUSION: These results support intra-capsular micro-enucleation as a safe and reliable treatment for every type of schwannoma. To minimize the risk of nerve injury, en bloc resection should not be used because the main purpose of schwannoma surgery is the relief of symptoms, not tumor resection. Thorough pre-operative counseling of patients to inform them of the potential occurrence of neurological deficit is important.},

The pathophysiology of syrinx formation is uncertain, and the appropriate management unclear. A series of cases is reported to demonstrate variations in etiology, uniformity of functional cerebrospinal fluid obstruction at the foramen magnum, and results of surgical intervention. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and radiologic features of a consecutive series of patients treated for syringomyelia related to CCJA. RESULTS: Eight patients (5 male, 28-66 years old) were treated from 2000 to 2016. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated cervicothoracic syringomyelia in all cases, with the rostral extension of the syrinx suggesting communication with the fourth ventricle in all but one case. There was reduction of foramen magnum cerebrospinal fluid space in all cases, cerebellar ectopia in 5 cases, and fourth ventricular entrapment in 3 cases. Treatment consisted of posterior fossa decompression with either a GoreTex or pericranial patch graft. Six patients had a fourth-ventricle spinal subarachnoid shunt. Two patients had titanium mesh cranioplasty. The immediate postoperative period was associated with reduction in syrinx cavity size and improvement in neurologic symptoms in all cases. At follow-up 10-60 months postoperatively, 3 patients exhibited recurrence of the syrinx and underwent successful reoperation at the craniocervical junction. One patient with persistence of the inferior component of the syrinx was treated with a syrinx-spinal subarachnoid shunt. CONCLUSIONS: Most syrinx cavities associated with CCJA communicate with the fourth ventricle. Posterior fossa decompression and fourth ventricle to spinal subarachnoid space shunting appears a reasonable treatment for this form of syringomyelia.},

Optimal management is unclear for idiopathic syringomyelia, or when treatment of the putative cause has failed or is high risk. Syrinx to subarachnoid shunting is an option for these cases; a series is reported to assess the outcomes of this approach. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and radiologic features of a consecutive series of patients with syringomyelia treated with syrinx to subarachnoid shunting. RESULTS: Forty-one patients (19 male, 4-79 years old) were treated from 2000 to 2016, including 15 patients with idiopathic syringomyelia, 13 with spinal trauma, 5 with Chiari malformation, 4 with arachnoiditis, 3 with tethered cord, and 1 with arachnoid bands. The patients were treated with a syrinx to subarachnoid shunt, and a subset~also underwent expansile duraplasty. At follow-up (3-108 months, mean 36 months) syrinx size was reduced in 37 patients, and there was improvement or stabilization of symptoms in all but 1 patient. Three patients had temporary lower limb sensory symptoms after surgery. Other complications were 2 transient cerebrospinal fluid leaks, a pseudomeningocoele, and 1 postoperative myocardial infarction. Two cases of shunt dislodgement required reoperation, and a third case required early reoperation for an enlarging syrinx. There were no cases of shunt blockage or infection. CONCLUSIONS: Syrinx to subarachnoid shunting is a safe and effective treatment for idiopathic syringomyelia and for patients who are not suitable for, or have not responded to, other treatment.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE The current management of atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD) focuses on the C1-2 joints, commonly approached through a posterior route. The distinction between reducible AAD (RAAD) and irreducible AAD (IrAAD) seems to be less important in modern times. The roles of preoperative traction and dynamic radiographs are questionable. This study evaluated whether differentiating between the 2 groups is important in today's era. METHODS Ninety-six consecutive patients with congenital AAD (33 RAAD and 63 IrAAD), who underwent surgery through a posterior approach alone, were studied. The preoperative and follow-up clinical statuses for both groups were studied and compared using Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores. The radiological findings of the 2 groups were compared, and the intraoperative challenges described. RESULTS A poor preoperative JOA score (clinical status) was seen in one-fifth of patients with IrAAD, although the mean JOA score was nearly similar in the RAAD and IrAAD groups. There was significant improvement in follow-up JOA score in both groups. However, segmentation defects (such as an assimilated arch of the atlas and C2-3 fusion) and anomalous vertebral arteries were found significantly more often in cases of IrAAD compared with those of RAAD. Os odontoideum was commonly seen in the RAAD group. The C1-2 joints were acute in IrAAD compared with RAAD. Preoperative traction in IrAAD resulted in vertical distraction and improvement in clinical and respiratory status. Surgery for IrAAD required much more drilling and manipulation of the C1-2 joints while safeguarding the anomalous vertebral artery. CONCLUSIONS Bony and vascular anomalies were much more common in patients with IrAAD, which made surgery more challenging than it was in RAAD despite similar approaches. An irreducible dislocation seen on preoperative radiographs made surgeons aware of difficulties that were likely to be encountered and helped them to better plan the surgery. Distraction achieved through preoperative traction reaffirmed the feasibility of intraoperative reduction. This made the differentiation between the 2 groups and the use of preoperative traction equally important.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paraclinoid or ophthalmic segment aneurysms arise from the internal carotid artery (ICA) between the roof of the cavernous sinus and the origin of the posterior communicating artery. Clinoid aneurysms arise between the proximal and distal carotid dural rings. The complex anatomy of clinoid and paraclinoid ICA aneurysms often makes them difficult to treat by microsurgery. The natural history of these aneurysms varies, based on their location and anatomic relationships. Accurate preoperative assessment of the origin of these aneurysms is therefore a critical aspect of their management. METHODS: The authors reviewed 35 clinoid and paraclinoid ICA aneurysms operated in 28 patients and classify them according to their anatomic location and angiographic pattern. The operative techniques, surgical outcomes, and indications for surgery are reviewed. RESULTS: Based on surgical anatomy and angiographic patterns, the aneurysms were classified into two categories: clinoid segment and paraclinoid (ophthalmic) segment. The clinoid segment aneurysms consisted of medial, lateral and anterior varieties. The paraclinoid aneurysms could be classified topographically into medial, posterior and anterior varieties, or based on the artery of origin into ophthalmic, superior, hypophyseal, and posterior paraclinoid aneurysms. Ophthalmic aneurysms were most common (40\%), followed by posterior ICA wall aneurysms (29\%), superior hypophyseal aneurysms (14\%), and clinoid aneurysms (17\%). Twenty patients (71\%) had single aneurysms. Of the remaining eight, six had bilateral aneurysms and two had unilateral multiple aneurysms. Of the 35 aneurysms, 32 were clipped satisfactorily, as confirmed by intraoperative or postoperative angiography. One small broad-based aneurysm was wrapped, and two others were treated by trapping and bypass techniques. Three patients who had bilateral aneurysms underwent successful clipping of four contralateral, left-sided aneurysms via a right frontotemporal, transorbital approach. On follow-up (mean, 39 months), 25 patients were in excellent condition (returned to their prior occupation), two were in good condition (independent, but not working), and one died postoperatively of vasospasm. CONCLUSION: Our increased knowledge of anatomy and refinements in operative techniques have greatly improved the surgical treatment of clinoid and paraclinoid aneurysms.},

The incidence of complications arising from increased IAP, known as intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) or abdominal compartment syndrome in critically ill patients, is high and its impact is significant. The effects of IAP in neurological conditions and during surgical procedures are largely unexplored. IAP also appears to be relevant during neurosurgical procedures (spine and brain) in the prone position, and in selected cases, IAH may affect cerebrospinal fluid drainage after a ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation. Furthermore, raised IAP is one of the contributors to intracranial hypertension in patients with morbid obesity. In traumatic brain injury, case reports described how abdominal decompression lowers intracerebral pressure. The anatomical substrate for transmission of the IAP to the brain and venous system of the spine is the extradural neural axis compartment; the first reports of this phenomenon can be found in anatomical studies of the sixteenth century. In this review, we summarize the available knowledge on how IAP impacts the cerebrospinal venous system and the jugular venous system via two pathways, and we discuss the implications for neurosurgical procedures as well as the relevance of IAH in neurological disorders.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review was performed on 21 adult patients surgically treated with high-grade spondylolisthesis (Grade III, IV, or V). Additionally, the natural history, classification, and surgical alternatives for high-grade spondylolisthesis in the adult are discussed through literature review. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to review the clinical and radiographic outcomes of surgical treatment of high-grade spondylolisthesis in the adult from a single institution. The natural history and treatment options for these adults are described in this review. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: High-grade spondylolisthesis is typically diagnosed and treated in the child or adolescent. Most patients with high-grade spondylolisthesis received surgical treatment during their adolescence. Some patients, however, remain minimally symptomatic for life without surgery. Little has been written on the natural history or treatment of adults with high grades of spondylolisthesis. Most of the published reports on the surgical treatment of high-grade spondylolisthesis pertain to skeletally immature patients and maybe include a few adults in their series. Nonetheless, the different techniques of surgical treatment for high-grade spondylolisthesis that have been described in these studies can help the spinal surgeon in treatment options for this rare but difficult spinal deformity. METHODS: A literature review of the published manuscripts on the treatment of high-grade spondylolisthesis was performed with particular attention to the natural history and surgical treatment involving adult patients. Adult patients (older than 21 years) with high-grade spondylolisthesis treated surgically were retrospectively reviewed. Patients' clinical charts and radiographs were reviewed before and after surgery. Determination of fusion success, clinical outcome, and complications were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-one consecutive adults with high-grade spondylolisthesis who underwent lumbar spinal surgery were review retrospectively between 1990 and 2004. There were 13 females and 8 males with an average age of 35 years (range, 21-68 years). The average follow-up was 6.6 years. There were 11 Grade III, 6 Grade IV, and 4 Grade V slips, including 4 acquired and 17 developmental spondylolistheses. There were no pseudarthroses or significant instrumentation failures. There was 1 case of a complete cauda equina syndrome on a patient with preoperative symptoms of an incomplete cauda equina syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients with high-grade spondylolisthesis not responding to nonoperative treatment can be stabilized in situ with posterior instrumentation from L4 to S1. The use of adjunctive fixation with iliac screws and/or transvertebral screws is recommended for the adult patient, particularly in revision or unstable cases. Reduction of the slipped vertebrae remains controversial for all grades of spondylolisthesis and more so for the adult patient. Partial reduction of the slip angle, decreasing the lumbosacral kyphosis, should be considered if significant sagittal malalignment is present or to improve arthrodesis success. Anterior column support should be performed, particularly when reduction has been obtained. Anterior column support can be performed, anteriorly or posteriorly, either by using inter vertebral body structural strut support or with a transsacral fibular dowel to improve stability and success of arthrodesis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For carefully selected patients with lumbar stenosis, decompression surgery is more efficacious than nonoperative treatment. However, some patients undergo repeat surgery, often because of complications, the failure to achieve solid fusion following arthrodesis procedures, or persistent symptoms. We assessed the probability of repeat surgery following operations for the treatment of lumbar stenosis and examined its association with patient age, comorbidity, previous surgery, and the type of surgical procedure. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of Medicare claims. The index operation was performed in 2004 (n = 31,543), with follow-up obtained through 2008. Operations were grouped by complexity as decompression alone, simple arthrodesis (one or two disc levels and a single surgical approach), or complex arthrodesis (more than two disc levels or combined anterior and posterior approach). Reoperation rates were calculated for each follow-up year, and the time to reoperation was analyzed with proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The probability of repeat surgery fell with increasing patient age or comorbidity. Aside from age, the strongest predictor was previous lumbar surgery: at four years the reoperation rate was 17.2\% among patients who had had lumbar surgery prior to the index operation, compared with 10.6\% among those with no prior surgery (p {$<$} 0.001). At one year, the reoperation rate for patients who had been managed with decompression alone was slightly higher than that for patients who had been managed with simple arthrodesis, but by four years the rates for these two groups were identical (10.7\%) and were lower than the rate for patients who had been managed with complex arthrodesis (13.5\%) (p {$<$} 0.001). This difference persisted after adjusting for demographic and clinical features (hazard ratio for complex arthrodesis versus decompression 1.56, 95\% confidence interval, 1.26 to 1.92). A device-related complication was reported at the time of 29.2\% of reoperations following an initial arthrodesis procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of repeat surgery for spinal stenosis declined with increasing age and comorbidity, perhaps because of concern for greater risks. The strongest clinical predictor of repeat surgery was a lumbar spine operation prior to the index operation. Arthrodeses were not significantly associated with lower rates of repeat surgery after the first postoperative year, and patients who had had complex arthrodeses had the highest rate of reoperations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent discussions on the relationship between intracranial aneurysm diameter and rupture probability have focused on the presence of an apparent critical diameter of 10 mm for aneurysm rupture. Despite the fact that many investigators have argued against the existence of this critical diameter, no one has yet proposed a viable alternative concept. In this report we present a scientifically rigorous alternative concept, that the size-specific rupture probability (RP) of an aneurysm varies as the third power of the aneurysm diameter. METHODS: We utilized a new biophysical model of aneurysm rupture that predicts the relationship between the size-specific rupture probability of an aneurysm and the diameter (D) to be RP = kD(3). We tested this hypothesis against data from two autopsy studies and one large clinical aneurysm study. Subsequently, using this D(3) hypothesis and the different size distributions of aneurysms in the study populations, we predicted the variation of cumulative rupture probability (CRP) with diameter for each population. RESULTS: Data from the autopsy studies supported the diameter-cube hypothesis, with the log-log plots of size-specific rupture probability versus aneurysm diameter from the two autopsy series yielding lines with slopes 3.54 (R(2) = 0.61, p {$<$} 0.12) and 3.05 (R(2) = 0.98, p {$<$} 0.001). Plots of cumulative rupture probability versus diameter were determined to be sensitive to the size distributions of the unruptured aneurysms in the population. Furthermore, none of the CRP plots showed evidence of a critical diameter for aneurysm rupture. CONCLUSIONS: RP varies as the third power of aneurysm diameter, a relationship that predicts a continuous increase in RP with increasing size rather than the existence of a threshold diameter that separates low- from high-risk aneurysms. Accordingly, all aneurysms have finite risk for rupture and deserve consideration for treatment. Much of the current controversy regarding the relationship between rupture rates and diameter is a result of different size distributions in study populations rather than differences in aneurysm biology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Posterolateral fusion with pedicle screw instrumentation is currently the most widely accepted technique for degenerative lumbar scoliosis in elderly patients. However, a high incidence of complications has been reported in most series. Dynamic stabilization without fusion in patients older than 60 years has not previously been compared with the use of posterior fusion in degenerative lumbar scoliosis. PURPOSE: To compare dynamic stabilization without fusion and posterior instrumented fusion in the treatment of degenerative lumbar scoliosis in elderly patients, in terms of perioperative findings, clinical outcomes, and adverse events. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Fifty-seven elderly patients were included. There were 45 women (78\%) and 12 men (22\%) with a mean age of 68.1 years (range, 61-78 years). All patients had degenerative de novo lumbar scoliosis, associated with vertebral canal stenosis in 51 cases (89.4\%) and degenerative spondylolisthesis in 24 patients (42.1\%). OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical (Oswestry Disability Index, visual analog scale, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) and radiological (scoliosis and lordosis corrections) outcomes as well as incidence of complications. METHODS: Patients were divided into two groups: 32 patients (dynamic group) had dynamic stabilization without fusion and 25 patients (fusion group) underwent posterior instrumented fusion. All the patients' medical records and X-rays were reviewed. Preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up questionnaires were obtained to evaluate clinical outcomes. RESULTS: At an average follow-up of 64 months (range, 42-90 months), clinical results improved similarly in both groups of patients. Statistically superior scoliosis and final lordosis corrections were achieved with posterior fusion (56.9\% vs. 37.3\% and -46.8\textdegree{} vs. -35.8\textdegree, respectively). However, in the dynamic group, incidence of overall complications was lower (25\% vs. 44\%), and fewer patients required revision surgery (6.2\% vs. 16\%). Furthermore, lower average values of operative duration (190 vs. 240 minutes) and blood loss (950 vs. 1,400 cc) were observed in the dynamic group than in the fusion group. CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients with degenerative lumbar scoliosis, pedicle screw-based dynamic stabilization was less invasive with shorter operative duration, less blood loss, and lower adverse event rates than instrumented posterior fusion. Scoliosis curve reduction and lumbar lordosis were superior after fusion; however, dynamic stabilization achieved satisfying values of both these parameters, and these results were stable after an average follow-up of more than 5 years. Furthermore, there was no difference between the two techniques in terms of functional clinical outcomes at the last follow-up.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE The pathophysiology underlying tonsillar herniation and CSF obstruction in Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) is unclear, and the cause of CM-I-associated syringomyelia is not well understood. A better understanding of this pathophysiology is important for an improved treatment strategy. Therefore, the authors sought to identify, characterize, and examine the intradural pathology and CSF flow pathophysiology in the posterior fossa and at the level of the foramen magnum that occurs in the setting of CM-I. They determined the incidence of these intradural findings and assessed differences across age, with the degree of tonsillar herniation, and in the presence and absence of syringomyelia. METHODS A prospective database initiated in March 2003 recorded all intraoperative findings during surgical treatment of children and adults with CM-I with or without syringomyelia. A total of 389 surgeries for CM-I were performed in 379 patients between March 2003 and June 2016. A total of 109 surgeries were performed in 109 patients with CM-I (without osseoligamentous abnormalities) in whom both a posterior fossa extradural and intradural decompression with duraplasty was performed (first-time intradural procedures). Using a surgical microscope, intradural pathology and obstruction of CSF channels were identified and assessed. Student t-tests and Fisher's exact tests compared groups in a series of univariate analyses, followed by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS The following intradural pathological entities were observed (prevalence noted in parentheses). These include those that did not obstruct CSF flow channels: opacified arachnoid (33.0\%), thickened arachnoid (3.7\%), ischemic and gliotic tonsils (40.4\%), tonsillar cysts (0.9\%), and inferior descent of the fourth ventricle and cervicomedullary junction (CMJ) (78.0\%). The following intradural pathological entities were observed to obstruct CSF flow channels: medialized tonsils (100\%), tonsil overlying and obstructing the foramen of Magendie (21.1\%), intertonsillar and tonsil to CMJ arachnoid adhesions (85.3\%), vermian posterior inferior cerebellar artery branches obstructing the foramen of Magendie (43.1\%), and arachnoid veils or webs obstructing or occluding the foramen of Magendie (52.3\%). Arachnoid veils varied in type and were observed in 59.5\% of patients with CM-I who had syringomyelia, which was significantly greater than the 33.3\% of patients with CM-I without syringomyelia who had an arachnoid veil (p = 0.018). The presence of CM-I with an arachnoid veil had 3.22 times the odds (p = 0.013, 95\% CI 1.29-8.07, by multivariate logistic regression) of being associated with syringomyelia, adjusting for tonsillar herniation. The inferior descent of the fourth ventricle and CMJ occurred with a greater degree of tonsillar herniation (p {$<$} 0.001) and correlated with a cervicomedullary kink or buckle on preoperative MRI. CONCLUSIONS Intradural pathology associated with CM-I with or without syringomyelia exists in many forms, is more prevalent than previously recognized in patients of all ages, and may play a role in the pathophysiology of CM-I tonsillar herniation. Arachnoid veils appear to partially obstruct CSF flow, are significantly more prevalent in cases of CM-I with syringomyelia, and therefore may play a role in the pathophysiology of CM-I-associated syringomyelia.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: More information about the association between preoperative anterior translation of the C-7 plumb line and clinical outcomes after decompression surgery in patients with lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSS) would help resolve problems for patients with sagittal imbalance. The authors evaluated whether preoperative sagittal alignment of the spine affects low-back pain and clinical outcomes after microendoscopic laminotomy. METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of prospectively collected surgical data. The study comprised 88 patients with LSS (47 men and 41 women) who ranged in age from 39 to 86 years (mean age 68.7 years). All patients had undergone microendoscopic laminotomy at Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine from May 2008 through October 2012. The minimum duration of clinical and radiological follow-up was 6 months. All patients were evaluated by Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores for low-back pain, leg pain, and leg numbness before and after surgery. The distance between the C-7 plumb line and the posterior corner of the sacrum (sagittal vertical axis [SVA]) was measured on lateral standing radiographs of the entire spine obtained before surgery. Radiological factors and clinical outcomes were compared between patients with a preoperative SVA {$\geq$} 50 mm (forward-bending trunk [F] group) and patients with a preoperative SVA {$<$} 50 mm (control [C] group). A total of 35 patients were allocated to the F group (19 male and 16 female) and 53 to the C group (28 male and 25 female). RESULTS: The mean SVA was 81.0 mm for patients in the F group and 22.0 mm for those in the C group. At final follow-up evaluation, no significant differences between the groups were found for the JOA score improvement ratio (73.3\% vs 77.1\%) or the VAS score for leg numbness (23.6 vs 24.0 mm); the VAS score for low-back pain was significantly higher for those in the F group (21.1 mm) than for those in the C group (11.0 mm); and the VAS score for leg pain tended to be higher for those in the F group (18.9 {$\pm$} 29.1 mm) than for those in the C group (9.4 {$\pm$} 16.0 mm). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative alignment of the spine in the sagittal plane did not affect JOA scores after microendoscopic laminotomy in patients with LSS. However, low-back pain was worse for patients with preoperative anterior translation of the C-7 plumb line than for those without.},

The purpose of this study was to identify the preoperative clinical and radiological factors that predict improvement in sagittal spinal alignment after decompressive surgery in patients with LSS. METHODS The records of 61 patients with LSS who underwent microendoscopic laminotomy and had pre- and postoperative clinical data collected were retrospectively reviewed. Spinopelvic parameters, including sagittal vertical axis (SVA), lumbar lordosis (LL), sacral slope, pelvic tilt, and pelvic incidence (PI), were evaluated. On T2-weighted MRI, the cross-sectional area and the percentage of fat infiltration of the paravertebral muscles (PVMs) before surgery were calculated. For patients with preoperative SVA {$>$} 40 mm (n = 30), the correlation between SVA improvement and preoperative clinical and radiographic parameters was calculated. RESULTS SVA improvement correlated with preoperative LL (r = -0.39) and PI -LL (r = 0.54). Multiple regression analysis showed that preoperative PI -LL (beta = 0.62; p {$<$} 0.01) and symptom duration (beta = -0.40; p {$<$} 0.05) were independently associated with SVA improvement. The percentage of fat infiltration of the PVM at L4-5 was significantly greater in patients with preoperative SVA {$\geq$} 40 mm than in those patients with SVA {$<$} 40 mm. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative PI -LL and symptom duration were independently associated with SVA improvement in LSS patients with forward-bending posture. PVM degeneration at the lower lumbar level was significantly greater among patients with preoperative SVA {$\geq$} 40 mm than in patients with SVA {$<$} 40 mm.},

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the peak voxel velocities are decreased by craniocervical decompression. METHODS: A consecutive series of patients with symptomatic Chiari I malformations was studied before and after craniocervical decompression with cardiac-gated, phase contrast MR imaging. Velocities were calculated for each voxel within the foramen magnum at 14 time points throughout the cardiac cycle. The greatest velocities measured in a voxel during the cephalad and caudad phases of CSF flow through the foramen magnum were tabulated for each patient before and after surgery. The differences in these velocities between the preoperative and postoperative studies were tested for statistical significance by using a single-tailed Student's t test of paired samples. RESULTS: Eight patients with a Chiari I malformation, including four with a syrinx, were studied. Peak caudad velocity diminished after craniocervical decompression in six of the eight patients, and the average diminished significantly from 3.4 cm/s preoperatively to 2.4 cm/s postoperatively (P =.01). Peak cephalad velocity diminished in six of the eight cases. The average diminished from 6.9 cm/s preoperatively to 3.9 cm/s postoperatively, a change that nearly reached the significance level of.05 (P =.055). CONCLUSION: Craniocervical decompression in patients with Chiari I malformations decreases peak CSF velocities in the foramen magnum. The study supports the hypothesis that successful treatment of the Chiari I malformation is associated with improvement in CSF flow patterns.},

Its effective disposal via various CSF routes has been demonstrated in animal models. In contrast, the CSF dynamics in humans are still poorly understood. Using novel real-time MRI, forced inspiration has been identified recently as a main driving force of CSF flow in the human brain. Exploiting technical advances toward real-time phase-contrast MRI, the current work analyzed directions, velocities, and volumes of human CSF flow within the brain aqueduct as part of the internal ventricular system and in the spinal canal during respiratory cycles. A consistent upward CSF movement toward the brain in response to forced inspiration was seen in all subjects at the aqueduct, in 11/12 subjects at thoracic level 2, and in 4/12 subjects at thoracic level 5. Concomitant analyses of CSF dynamics and cerebral venous blood flow, that is, in epidural veins at cervical level 3, uniquely demonstrated CSF and venous flow to be closely communicating cerebral fluid systems in which inspiration-induced downward flow of venous blood due to reduced intrathoracic pressure is counterbalanced by an upward movement of CSF. The results extend our understanding of human CSF flux and open important clinical implications, including concepts for drug delivery and new classifications and therapeutic options for various forms of hydrocephalus and idiopathic intracranial hypertension.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Effective disposal of brain cellular waste products via CSF has been demonstrated repeatedly in animal models. However, CSF dynamics in humans are still poorly understood. A novel quantitative real-time MRI technique yielded in vivo CSF flow directions, velocities, and volumes in the human brain and upper spinal canal. CSF moved upward toward the head in response to forced inspiration. Concomitant analysis of brain venous blood flow indicated that CSF and venous flux act as closely communicating systems. The finding of a human CSF-venous network with upward CSF net movement opens new clinical concepts for drug delivery and new classifications and therapeutic options for various forms of hydrocephalus and ideopathic intracranial hypertension.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Despite extensive clinical experience with laminoplasty, the efficacy of the procedure and its advantages over laminectomy remain unclear. Specific clinical elements, such as incidence or progression of kyphosis, incidence of axial neck pain, postoperative cervical range of motion, and incidence of postoperative C-5 palsies, are of concern. The authors sought to comprehensively review the laminoplasty literature over the past 10 years while focusing on these clinical elements. METHODS: The authors conducted a literature search of articles in the Medline database published between 2003 and 2013, in which the terms "laminoplasty," "laminectomy," and "posterior cervical spine procedures" were used as key words. Included was every single case series in which patient outcomes after a laminoplasty procedure were reported. Excluded were studies that did not report on at least one of the above-mentioned items. RESULTS: A total of 103 studies, the results of which contained at least 1 of the prespecified outcome variables, were identified. These studies reported 130 patient groups comprising 8949 patients. There were 3 prospective randomized studies, 1 prospective nonrandomized alternating study, 15 prospective nonrandomized data collections, and 84 retrospective reviews. The review revealed a trend for the use of miniplates or hydroxyapatite spacers on the open side in Hirabayashi-type laminoplasty or on the open side in a Kurokawa-type laminoplasty. Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scoring was reported most commonly; in the 4949 patients for whom a JOA score was reported, there was improvement from a mean ({$\pm$} SD) score of 9.91 ({$\pm$} 1.65) to a score of 13.68 ({$\pm$} 1.05) after a mean follow-up of 44.18 months ({$\pm$} 35.1 months). The mean preoperative and postoperative C2-7 angles (available for 2470 patients) remained stable from 14.17\textdegree{} ({$\pm$} 0.19\textdegree ) to 13.98\textdegree{} ({$\pm$} 0.19\textdegree ) of lordosis (average follow-up 39 months). The authors found significantly decreased kyphosis when muscle/posterior element-sparing techniques were used (p = 0.02). The use of hardware in the form of hydroxyapatite spacers or miniplates did not influence the progression of deformity (p = 0.889). An overall mean (calculated from 2390 patients) of 47.3\% loss of range of motion was reported. For the studies that used a visual analog scale score (totaling 986 patients), the mean (cohort size-adjusted) postoperative pain level at a mean follow-up of 29 months was 2.78. For the studies that used percentages of patients who complained of postoperative axial neck pain (totaling 1249 patients), the mean patient number-adjusted percentage was 30\% at a mean follow-up of 51 months. The authors found that 16\% of the studies that were published in the last 10 years reported a C-5 palsy rate of more than 10\% (534 patients), 41\% of the studies reported a rate of 5\%-10\% (n = 1006), 23\% of the studies reported a rate of 1\%-5\% (n = 857), and 12.5\% reported a rate of 0\% (n = 168). CONCLUSIONS: Laminoplasty remains a valid option for decompression of the spinal cord. An understanding of the importance of the muscle-ligament complex, plus the introduction of hardware, has led to progress in this type of surgery. Reporting of outcome metrics remains variable, which makes comparisons among the techniques difficult.},

This study evaluates the prevalence of venous sinus stenosis and hypoplasia in the general patient population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 355 of 600 consecutive patients who underwent CT angiography of the head met the inclusion criteria. The diameters of the dural venous sinuses were recorded. Each study was evaluated by a neuroradiologist for the presence of stenoses. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed by a statistician. RESULTS: The prevalence of unilateral transverse sinus stenosis or hypoplasia in a sample of patients representing the general population was 33\%, the prevalence of bilateral transverse sinus stenosis was 5\%, and the prevalence of unilateral stenosis with contralateral hypoplasia was 1\%. A multivariate analysis identified arachnoid granulations as a predictor of stenosis (p{$<$}0.001). Gender trended toward significance (p=0.094). Race was not a significant predictor of stenosis (p=0.745). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of bilateral transverse sinus stenosis in the general population is not trivial. These data may be used as a reference for understanding the mechanistic role of stenoses in idiopathic intracranial hypertension, tinnitus, and refractory headaches.},

The authors review their surgical experience between 1975 and 1985 with 50 patients afflicted with symptomatic Chiari malformations. Any patient with associated myelomeningocele, tethered spinal cord, lipoma, or diastematomyelia was excluded from this series. Forty-one patients had Chiari I malformations, seven were classified as having Chiari II, and two as having Chiari III. The presentation of pediatric and adult patients was identical. Treatment was directed at the posterior fossa pathology. Seven patients with accompanying ventral bone compression underwent transoral decompression of the cervicomedullary junction, 42 had posterior decompressive procedures, and six received ventriculoperitoneal shunts. The posterior decompression included opening the outlet foramina of the fourth ventricle, occluding any communication between the spinal cord central canal and the obex, shunting the fourth ventricle, and placing a dural graft. Postoperatively, 20\% of the patients are asymptomatic, 66\% improved, and 8\% stabilized; in 6\% the disease has progressed in spite of multiple procedures. Preoperative signs that are predictive of a less favorable outcome include muscle atrophy, symptoms lasting longer than 24 months, ataxia, nystagmus, trigeminal hypesthesia, and dorsal column dysfunction (p less than 0.05, chi-square test). A model based on the presence or absence of atrophy, ataxia, and scoliosis at the time of the preoperative examination has been generated that allows prediction of long-term outcome at the 95\% confidence level.},

Our purpose was to visualize the lumbar nerve root and to analyze its morphology, and to measure its apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in healthy volunteers and patients with lumbar foraminal stenosis using 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging. Fourteen patients with lumbar foraminal stenosis and 14 healthy volunteers were studied. Regions of interest were placed at the fourth and fifth lumbar root at dorsal root ganglia and distal spinal nerves (at L4 and L5) and the first sacral root and distal spinal nerve (S1) on DWI to quantify mean ADC values. The anatomic parameters of the spinal nerve roots can also be determined by neurography. In patients, mean ADC values were significantly higher in entrapped roots and distal spinal nerve than in intact ones. Neurography also showed abnormalities such as nerve indentation, swelling and running transversely in their course through the foramen. In all patients, leg pain was ameliorated after selective decompression (n = 9) or nerve block (n = 5). We demonstrated the first use of DWI and neurography of human lumbar nerves to visualize and quantitatively evaluate lumbar nerve entrapment with foraminal stenosis. We believe that DWI is a potential tool for diagnosis of lumbar nerve entrapment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Age-related sarcopenia can cause various forms of physical disabilities. We investigated how sarcopenia affects degenerative lumbar scoliosis (DLS) and lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSCS). METHODS: Subjects comprised 40 elderly women (mean age 74~years) with spinal disease whose chief complaints were low back pain and lower limb pain. They included 15 cases of DLS (mean 74.8~years) and 25 cases of LSCS (mean age 72.9~years). We performed whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to analyze body composition, including appendicular and trunk skeletal muscle mass index (SMI; lean mass (kg)/height (m)2) and bone mineral density (BMD). A diagnostic criterion for sarcopenia was an appendicular SMI {$<$}5.46. To check spinal alignment, lumbar scoliosis (LS), sagittal vertical axis (SVA), thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic tilt (PT), pelvic incidence (PI), sacral slope (SS), and vertebral rotational angle (VRA) were measured. Clinical symptoms were determined from the Japanese Orthopedic Association scores, low back pain visual analog scale, and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ). Criteria for DLS were lumbar scoliosis {$>$}10\textdegree{} and a sagittal vertical axis (SVA) {$>$}50~mm. Sarcopenia prevalence, correlations between spinal alignment, BMD, and clinical symptoms with appendicular and trunk SMIs, and correlation between spinal alignment and clinical symptoms were investigated. RESULTS: DLS cases had significantly lower body weight, BMI, lean mass arm, and total lean mass than LSCS cases. Sarcopenia prevalence rates were 4/25 cases (16\%) in LSCS and 7/15 cases (46.6\%) in DLS, revealing a high prevalence in DLS. Appendicular SMIs were DLS 5.61 and LSCS 6.13 (p\,{$<$}\,0.05), and trunk SMIs were DLS 6.91 and LSCS 7.61 (p\,{$<$}\,0.01) showing DLS to have significantly lower values than LSCS. Spinal alignment correlations revealed the appendicular SMI was negatively correlated with PT (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) and the trunk SMI was found to have a significant negative correlation with SVA, PT, LS, and VRA (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). The trunk SMI was found to have a significant positive correlation with BMD (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). As for clinical symptoms, RDQ was negatively correlated with appendicular SMI and positively correlated with PT (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia complications were noted in 16\% of LSCS patients and a much higher percentage, or 46.6\%, of DLS patients. Appendicular and trunk SMIs were both lower in DLS, suggesting that sarcopenia may be involved in scoliosis. The appendicular skeletal muscle was related to posterior pelvic tilt, while the trunk muscle affected stooped posture, posterior pelvic tilt, lumbar scoliosis, and vertebral rotation. Decreases in trunk muscle mass were also associated with osteoporosis. Moreover, RDQ had a negative correlation with appendicular skeletal muscle mass and a positive correlation with PT, suggesting that sarcopenia may be associated with low back pain as a result of posterior pelvic tilt. Our research reveals for the first time how sarcopenia is involved in spinal deformations, suggesting decreases in pelvic/lumbar support structures such as trunk and appendicular muscle mass may be involved in the progression of spinal deformities and increased low back pain.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The surgical management of lesions ventral to the neuraxis at the level of the craniovertebral junction (CVJ) and upper cervical spine is challenging. Here, the authors describe a minimally invasive dorsal approach for small ventrally located intradural lesions at the CVJ as an alternative for the more extensive classic transoral approach or variants of suboccipital approaches. METHODS: Between 2012 and 2014, 6 symptomatic patients with a small lesion of the ventral aspect at the CVJ level were treated using a minimally invasive dorsal approach at the University Medical Center in Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany. The anatomical distance between the posterior atlantooccipital membrane and the posterior atlantoaxial ligament, as determined by CT images, was assessed in the treated patients and in 100 untreated persons. RESULTS: The authors treated 6 patients (mean age 54.7 years) who had a clinical presentation of mild neurological symptoms that disappeared after resection. Minimally invasive surgical dorsal access was achieved by using tubular systems and using the natural space between the occiput (C-0) and C-1, and in 1 case between C-1 and C-2, without having to remove bony structures. The postoperative course in each of the 6 patients was uneventful. The neuropatho-logical findings confirmed a meningotheliomatous meningioma (WHO Grade I) in 5 cases and an extramedullary cavernous hemangioma in 1 case. MRI confirmed complete resection of all the lesions. The atlantooccipital distances ranged from 3 to 17 mm (mean 8.98 mm) in the supine neutral position, and the atlantoaxial distances ranged from 5 to 17 mm (mean 10.56 mm). There were no significant differences between women and men (atlantooccipital p = 0.14; atlantoaxial p = 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that the minimally invasive dorsal approach using the space between C-0 and C-1 or C-1 and C-2 provides direct and sufficient exposure for the safe surgical resection of small ventrally located intradural lesions at the CVJ level while reducing the necessity for musculoskeletal preparation to a minimum.},

In this study we investigate the solutions obtained by applying the Lax-Wendroff and MacCormack schemes to one-dimensional incompressible flow through a straight collapsible tube. The time-evolving numerical results were compared with exact steady-state solutions. For boundary conditions which were held fixed after a prescribed rise time, the unsteady numerical solution converges to the exact steady-state solution with very good accuracy. The stability and accuracy of all the methods depend on the amount of viscous pressure loss dictated by wall friction. Flows with undamped oscillations cannot, however, be solved with these techniques.},

  abstract = {Syringomyelia is a disease in which fluid-filled cavities, called syrinxes, form in the spinal cord causing progressive loss of sensory and motor functions. Invasive monitoring of pressure waves in the spinal subarachnoid space implicates a hydrodynamic origin. Poor treatment outcomes have led to myriad hypotheses for its pathogenesis, which unfortunately are often based on small numbers of patients due to the relative rarity of the disease. However, only recently have models begun to appear based on the principles of mechanics. One such model is the mathematically rigorous work of Carpenter and colleagues (2003, "Pressure Wave Propagation in Fluid-Filled Co-Axial Elastic Tubes Part 1: Basic Theory," ASME J. Biomech. Eng., 125(6), pp. 852-856; 2003, "Pressure Wave Propagation in Fluid-Filled Co-Axial Elastic Tubes Part 2: Mechanisms for the Pathogenesis of Syringomyelia," ASME J. Biomech. Eng., 125(6), pp. 857-863). They suggested that a pressure wave due to a cough or sneeze could form a shocklike elastic jump, which when incident at a stenosis, such as a hindbrain tonsil, would generate a transient region of high pressure within the spinal cord and lead to fluid accumulation. The salient physiological parameters of this model were reviewed from the literature and the assumptions and predictions re-evaluated from a mechanical standpoint. It was found that, while the spinal geometry does allow for elastic jumps to occur, their effects are likely to be weak and subsumed by the small amount of viscous damping present in the subarachnoid space. Furthermore, the polarity of the pressure differential set up by cough-type impulses opposes the tenets of the elastic-jump hypothesis. The analysis presented here does not support the elastic-jump hypothesis or any theory reliant on cough-based pressure impulses as a mechanism for the pathogenesis of syringomyelia.},

  abstract = {Fluid transport in syringomyelia has remained enigmatic ever since the disease was first identified some three centuries ago. However, accumulating evidence in the last decade from animal studies implicates arterial pulsations in syrinx formation. In particular, it has been suggested that a phase difference between the pressure pulse in the spinal subarachnoid space and the perivascular spaces, due to a pathologically disturbed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood supply, could result in a net influx of CSF into the spinal cord (SC). A lumped-parameter model is developed of the cerebrospinal system to investigate this conjecture. It is found that although this phase-lag mechanism may operate, it requires the SC to have an intrinsic storage capacity due to the collapsibility of the contained venous reservoir. This net flux is associated with a higher mean pressure in the SC than the SSS which is maintained in the periodic steady state. According to our simulations the mechanical perturbations of arachnoiditis exacerbate the phase-lag effect, which may be partially alleviated by the presence of a posttraumatic syrinx and more completely by a syringo-subarachnoid shunt.},

While the aetiology remains uncertain, hydrodynamics appear to play a role. This has led to the involvement of engineers, who have modelled the system in silico and on the bench. In the process, hypotheses from the neurosurgical literature have been tested, and others generated, while aspects of the system mechanics have been clarified. The spinal cord is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which is subject both to the periodic excitation of CSF expelled from the head with each heartbeat, and to intermittent larger transients from cough, sneeze, etc., via vertebral veins. The resulting pulsatile flow and pressure wave propagation, and their possible effects on cord cavities and cord stresses, have been elucidated. These engineering contributions are here reviewed for the first time.},

  abstract = {Invasive evaluations play important roles in identifying epileptogenic zones and functional areas in patients with intractable focal epilepsy. This article reviews the usefulness, methods, and limitations of invasive evaluations for epilepsy surgery. Invasive evaluations include various types of intracranial electrodes such as stereotactically implanted intracranial depth electrodes (stereo-EEG), chronic subdural electrodes, and intraoperative electrocorticography. Scalp EEG is distorted by the skull, meninges, and skin. On the other hand, intracranial electrodes provide spatial information with higher resolution than scalp electrodes, thereby enabling further delineation of epileptogenic zones and mapping of functional areas with electrical stimulation. In addition, intracranial electrodes record a wide frequency range of electrical activity, which is not possible with scalp electrodes. The very slow potentials in ictal recordings, known as ictal direct current (DC) shifts and ictal/interictal high frequency oscillations, such as ripples (100-200 Hz) and fast ripples (200-500 Hz), have been correlated with the ictal onset zone and are a sensitive and specific marker for epileptogenicity. Furthermore, several studies reported that the electrical stimulation of epileptogenic zones elicited enhanced cortical evoked potentials, abnormal delayed or repetitive responses, and fast ripples. These responses may assist in the delineation of the epileptogenic cortex as a potential new marker. There are definite risks of complications associated with the use of intracranial electrodes. However, when an invasive evaluation is selected based on careful consideration of the risks and benefits, it provides useful information for establishing a strategy for epilepsy surgery.},

  abstract = {A retrospective cross-sectional study was designed to evaluate total sagittal spinal alignment in patients with lumbar disc herniation (LDH) and healthy subjects. Abnormal sagittal spinal alignment could cause persistent low back pain in lumbar disease. Previous studies analyzed sciatic scoliotic list in patients with lumbar disc herniation; but there is little or no information on the relationship between sagittal alignment and subjective findings. The study subjects were 61 LDH patients and 60 age-matched healthy subjects. Preoperative and 6-month postoperatively lateral whole-spine standing radiographs were assessed for the distance between C7 plumb line and posterior superior corner on the top margin of S1 sagittal vertical axis (SVA), lumbar lordotic angle between the top margin of the first lumbar vertebra and first sacral vertebra (L1S1), pelvic tilting angle (PA), and pelvic morphologic angle (PRS1). Subjective symptoms were evaluated by the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score for lower back pain (nine points). The mean SVA value of the LDH group (32.7 +/- 46.5 mm, +/- SD) was significantly larger than that of the control (2.5 +/- 17.1 mm), while L1S1 was smaller (36.7 +/- 14.5 degrees ) and PA was larger (25.1 +/- 9.0 degrees ) in LDH than control group (49.0 +/- 10.0 degrees and 18.2 +/- 6.0 degrees , respectively). At 6 months after surgery, the malalignment recovered to almost the same level as the control group. SVA correlated with the subjective symptoms measured by the JOA score. Sagittal spinal alignment in LDH exhibits more anterior translation of the C7 plumb line, less lumbar lordosis, and a more vertical sacrum. Measurements of these spinal parameters allowed assessment of the pathophysiology of LDH.},

The purpose of this paper is to examine the potential utility of ICG videoangiography in the surgical treatment of intramedullary CMs. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of 8 cases involving 5 men and 3 women who had undergone surgery for intramedullary CM between January 2008 and July 2011. All patients were evaluated by means of MRI. The MRI findings and clinical history in all cases suggested intramedullary CM as a preoperative diagnosis. In 2 of 8 cases, dilated venous structures associated with CMs were demonstrated. In one of these cases, there were coexisting extramedullary CMs. Intraoperatively, ICG fluorescence was observed for 5 minutes using microscope-integrated videoangiography. RESULTS: In all 8 cases, intra- and extramedullary CMs were seen as avascular areas on ICG videoangiography. Indocyanine green videoangiography helped surgeons to localize and predict margins of the lesions before performing myelotomy. Importantly, in the cases with associated venous anomalies, ICG videoangiography was useful in delineating and preserving the venous structures. In extramedullary CMs located dorsal to the spinal cord, gradual ICG infiltration was seen, starting at 110 seconds and maximal at 210 seconds after injection. Postoperative MRI confirmed total removal of the lesions in all cases, and subsequent recovery of all patients was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS: Indocyanine green videoangiography provided useful information with regard to the detection of lesion margins by demonstrating intramedullary CMs as avascular areas. In cases associated with venous anomalies, ICG contributed to safe and complete removal of the CMs by visualizing the venous structure. In extramedullary CMs, ICG videoangiography demonstrated the characteristic of slow blood flow within CMs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Case series (CS) are well-known designs in contemporary use in neurosurgery but are sometimes used in contexts that are incompatible with their true meaning as defined by epidemiologists. This inconsistent, inappropriate and incorrect use, and mislabeling impairs the appropriate indexing and sorting of evidence. METHOD: Using PubMed, we systematically identified published articles that had "case series" in the "title" in 15 top-ranked neurosurgical journals from January 2008 to December 2012. The abstracts and/or full articles were scanned to identify those with descriptions of the principal method as being "case series" and then classified as "true case series" or "non-case series" by two independent investigators with 100 \% inter-rater agreement. RESULTS: Sixty-four articles had the label "case series" in their "titles." Based on the definition of "case series" and our appraisal of the articles using Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines, 18 articles (28.13 \%) were true case series, while 46 (71.87 \%) were mislabeled. Thirty-five articles (54.69 \%) mistook retrospective (descriptive) cohorts for CS. CS are descriptive with an outcome-based sampling, while "descriptive cohorts" have an exposure-based sampling of patients, followed over time to assess outcome(s). A comparison group is not a defining feature of a cohort study and distinguishes descriptive from analytic cohorts. CONCLUSION: A distinction between a case report, case series, and descriptive cohorts is absolutely necessary to enable the appropriate indexing, sorting, and application of evidence. Researchers need better training in methods and terminology, and editors and reviewers should scrutinize more carefully manuscripts claiming to be "case series" studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To address the increasing need to counsel patients about treatment indications for unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA), we endeavored to develop a consensus on assessment of UIAs among a group of specialists from diverse fields involved in research and treatment of UIAs. METHODS: After composition of the research group, a Delphi consensus was initiated to identify and rate all features, which may be relevant to assess UIAs and their treatment by using ranking scales and analysis of inter-rater agreement (IRA) for each factor. IRA was categorized as very high, high, moderate, or low. RESULTS: Ultimately, 39 specialists from 4 specialties agreed (high or very high IRAs) on the following key factors for or against UIA treatment decisions: (1) patient age, life expectancy, and comorbid diseases; (2) previous subarachnoid hemorrhage from a different aneurysm, family history for UIA or subarachnoid hemorrhage, nicotine use; (3) UIA size, location, and lobulation; (4) UIA growth or de novo formation on serial imaging; (5) clinical symptoms (cranial nerve deficit, mass effect, and thromboembolic events from UIAs); and (6) risk factors for UIA treatment (patient age and life expectancy, UIA size, and estimated risk of treatment). However, IRAs for features rated with low relevance were also generally low, which underlined the existing controversy about the natural history of UIAs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight that neurovascular specialists currently consider many features as important when evaluating UIAs but also highlight that the appreciation of natural history of UIAs remains uncertain, even within a group of highly informed individuals.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: An occult tight filum terminale syndrome has been described wherein clinical symptoms result from tension on the spinal cord despite nondiagnostic spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recent reports have suggested a role for surgical untethering in this patient population; however, controversy remains regarding the surgical treatment of this condition. Owing to the various clinical presentations, the relationship of presenting signs and symptoms to postoperative outcomes might be useful in surgical selection. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of 22 pediatric cases of surgical untethering for suspected occult tight filum terminale syndrome. All patients had nondiagnostic MRI findings, defined as a conus medullaris above the L(3) vertebral body and a filum terminale diameter of less than 2 mm. Preoperative symptoms, signs and urodynamic test results were collected and compared with surgical outcomes determined by clinical notes and postoperative urodynamics reports. Abnormal findings on presentation were categorized as dermatologic, urologic, orthopedic and neurologic. RESULTS: Patient age ranged from 7 months to 17 years, and 12 were female. Sixteen (73\%) patients experienced subjective and/or objective improvement following surgical untethering. Fourteen patients had abnormal preoperative urodynamic testing, of which 12 underwent postoperative urodynamic testing. Five of these 12 (42\%) demonstrated objective improvement postoperatively. Patients presenting with abnormal findings in at least 2 categories were more likely to improve following untethering (88\%) than those with abnormalities in only 1 category (20\%; p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Spinal cord untethering is a treatment option for occult tight filum terminale syndrome. Further evaluation of the relationship between preoperative findings and surgical outcomes may facilitate the selection of surgical candidates.},

  abstract = {Chiari I malformation has been shown to present different cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow patterns at the cranial-vertebral junction (CVJ). Posterior fossa decompression is the first-line treatment for symptomatic Chiari I malformation. However, there is still controversy on the indication and selection of decompression procedures. This research aims to investigate the clinical indications, outcomes, and complications of the decompression procedures as alternative treatments for Chiari I malformation, based on the different CSF flow patterns at the cranial-vertebral junction. In this study, 126 Chiari I malformation patients treated with the two decompression procedures were analyzed. According to the preoperative findings obtained by using cine phase-contrast MRI (cine PC-MRI), the abnormal CSF flow dynamics at the CVJ in Chiari I malformation was classified into three patterns. After a preoperative evaluation and an intraoperative ultrasound after craniectomy, the two procedures were alternatively selected to treat the Chiari I malformation. The indication and selection of the two surgical procedures, as well as their outcomes and complications, are reported in detail in this work. Forty-eight patients underwent subdural decompression (SDD), and 78 received subarachnoid manipulation (SAM). Ninety patients were diagnosed as having Chiari I malformation with a syrinx. Two weeks after the operation, the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) scores increased from the preoperative value of 10.67~{$\pm~$}1.61 to 12.74~{$\pm~$}2.01 (P~{$<~$}0.01). The mean duration of follow-up was 24.8~months; the mJOA scores increased from the postoperative value of 12.74~{$\pm~$}2.01 to 12.79~{$\pm~$}1.91 at the end of follow-up (P~=~0.48). More complications occurred in the patients who underwent SAM than in those who received SDD (SAM 11 of 78 (9.5\%) vs SDD 2 of 48 (3.5\%)). The abnormal CSF flow dynamics at the CVJ in Chiari I malformation can be classified into three patterns. A SAM procedure is more feasible in Chiari I malformation (CM1) patients with pattern III CSF flow dynamics, whereas a SDD procedure is more suitable for CM1 patients with pattern I CSF flow dynamics. In CM1 patients with pattern II CSF flow dynamics, an intraoperative ultrasound after craniectomy could play an important role in the selection of an effective decompression procedure.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To identify prognostic factors for curve progression in de novo degenerative lumbar scoliosis (DNDLS) by performing a systematic review of the literature. METHODS: Studies were selected for inclusion following a systematic search in the bibliographic databases PubMed and EMBASE prior to September 2015 and hand searches of the reference lists of retrieved articles. Two authors independently assessed methodological quality. Data were extracted and presented according to a best evidence synthesis. RESULTS: The literature search generated a total of 2696 references. After removing duplicates and articles that did not meet inclusion criteria, 12 studies were included. Due to the lack of statistical analyses, pooling of data was not possible. Strong evidence indicates that increasing intervertebral disk degeneration, lateral vertebral translation {$\geq$}6~mm, and an intercrest line through L5 (rather than L4) are associated with DNDLS curve progression. Moderate evidence suggests that apical vertebral rotation Grade II or III is associated with curve progression. For the majority of other prognostic factors, we found limited, conflicting, or inconclusive evidence. Osteoporosis, a coronal Cobb angle {$<$}30\textdegree, lumbar lordosis, lateral osteophytes difference of {$\geq$}5~mm, and degenerative spondylolisthesis have not been shown to be risk factors. Clinical risk factors for progression were not identified. CONCLUSIONS: This review shows strong evidence that increased intervertebral disk degeneration, an intercrest line through L5, and apical lateral vertebral translation {$\geq$}6~mm are associated with DNDLS curve progression. Moderate evidence was found for apical vertebral rotation (Grade II/III) as a risk factor for curve progression. These results, however, may not be directly applicable to the individual patient.},

Using a novel scoring system, each reader graded the degree of stenosis seen in the transverse and sigmoid sinuses of each patient. RESULTS: There was excellent agreement across the three readers for application of the grading system. Substantial bilateral sinovenous stenoses were seen in 27 of 29 patients with IIH and in only 4 of 59 control patients. CONCLUSION: Using ATECO MRV and a novel grading system for quantifying sinovenous stenoses, the authors can identify IIH patients with sensitivity and specificity of 93\%.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The paper ''Nomenclature and classification of lumbar disc pathology, recommendations of the combined task forces of the North American Spine Society, the American Society of Spine Radiology and the American Society of Neuroradiology,'' was published in 2001 in Spine (\textcopyright{} Lippincott, Williams \& Wilkins). It was authored by David Fardon, MD, and Pierre Milette, MD, and formally endorsed by the American Society of Spine Radiology (ASSR), American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR), and North American Spine Society (NASS). Its purpose was to promote greater clarity and consistency of usage of spinal terminology, and it has served this purpose well for over a decade. Since 2001, there has been sufficient evolution in our understanding of the lumbar disc to suggest the need for revision and updating of the original document. The revised document is presented here, and it represents the consensus recommendations of contemporary combined task forces of the ASSR, ASNR, and NASS. This article reflects changes consistent with current concepts in radiologic and clinical care. PURPOSE: To provide a resource that promotes a clear understanding of lumbar disc terminology amongst clinicians, radiologists, and researchers. All the concerned need standard terms for the normal and pathologic conditions of lumbar discs that can be used accurately and consistently and thus best serve patients with disc disorders. STUDY DESIGN: This article comprises a review of the literature. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed for literature pertaining to the lumbar disc. The task force members individually and collectively reviewed the literature and revised the 2001 document. The revised document was then submitted for review to the governing boards of the ASSR, ASNR, and NASS. After further revision based on the feedback from the governing boards, the article was approved for publication by the governing boards of the three societies, as representative of the consensus recommendations of the societies. RESULTS: The article provides a discussion of the recommended diagnostic categories pertaining to the lumbar disc: normal; congenital/developmental variation; degeneration; trauma; infection/inflammation; neoplasia; and/or morphologic variant of uncertain significance. The article provides a glossary of terms pertaining to the lumbar disc, a detailed discussion of these terms, and their recommended usage. Terms are described as preferred, nonpreferred, nonstandard, and colloquial. Updated illustrations pictorially portray certain key terms. Literature references that provided the basis for the task force recommendations are included. CONCLUSIONS: We have revised and updated a document that, since 2001, has provided a widely acceptable nomenclature that helps maintain consistency and accuracy in the description of the anatomic and physiologic properties of the normal and abnormal lumbar disc and that serves as a system for classification and reporting built upon that nomenclature.},

  abstract = {OBJECT Despite advances in surgical and anesthesiology techniques, many patients continue to experience postoperative pain after lumbar disc operations. This study aims to investigate the effects of methylene blue (MB) on preventing postoperative low-back pain (LBP) with or without radicular pain and improving the quality of life (QOL) in patients undergoing lumbar open discectomy. METHODS This is a prospective, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, which was conducted at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences between July 2011 to January 2012. Of a total of 130 patients, 115 were eligible for participation; 56 received 1 ml of MB solution at a concentration of 0.5\% (MB group) and 59 received an equivalent volume of normal saline (control group). Primary outcomes were the control of LBP with or without radicular pain, which was evaluated preoperatively and at 24 hours and 3 months after surgery with the use of a visual analog scale (VAS), and the improvement of QOL, which was assessed preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively by means of the Persian translation of the Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire. RESULTS The mean VAS scores for LBP were significantly lower in the MB group compared with the control group at 24 hours (1.25 {$\pm$} 0.97 vs 2.80 {$\pm$} 0.69, p {$<$} 0.001) and 3 months (1.02 {$\pm$} 1.29 vs 2.07 {$\pm$} 1.10, p = 0.019) after treatment. The mean radicular pain scores decreased significantly in the 2 groups at 24 hours after surgery, but the mean radicular pain score was significantly lower in the MB-treated patients than the control group. However, the difference between radicular pain scores in the MB group (1 {$\pm$} 1.1) and the control group (1.2 {$\pm$} 1) was not statistically significant (p = 0.64). The reduction in LBP was greater in the MB group than the control group (8.11 {$\pm$} 1.74 vs 6.07 {$\pm$} 1.52, p = 0.023, CI 95\% -1.37 to -0.10). The functional QOL improved significantly 3 months after the operation in both groups (p {$<$} 0.001). Moderate disability occurred more frequently in the control group than in the MB group (14.5\% vs 7.7\%, p = 0.004). No toxicity, adverse effects, or complications were found in the group of patients treated with MB injection. CONCLUSIONS A single dose of MB (1 ml 0.5\%) for coating the dura and surrounding tissues (facet and muscle) shows promising results in terms of safety, reduction of postoperative pain, and functional outcome compared with placebo.},

METHODS: The surgical technique of FN sparing in large VS includes patient-tailored image-guided craniotomy, continuous intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (INM), intracapsular wide tumor debulking, and only final extracapsular dissection with FN course identification and brainstem decompression. A small amount of residual tumor along the FN is accepted in order to not damage the nerve. Postoperative radiosurgery workup is then recommended. CONCLUSIONS: NTR/STR resection with FN function sparing is a valid option for large VS.},

However, until now, such motion has not been well characterized in three dimensions. While previous studies have predominantly examined motion in the superior/inferior (S/I) direction, the foci of the present study were the anterior/posterior (A/P) and right/left (R/L) components of human cervical and upper thoracic SC motion. Cardiac-gated, turbofast low-angle shot (turbo-FLASH) cinematic MRI was employed at 3T to acquire images of the cord at 24 phases throughout the cardiac cycle. Time-dependent signal fluctuations within voxels adjacent to the cord/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interface were then used to measure SC motion, which was found to occur predictably as a function of cardiac activity. Cord movement was largest in the A/P direction, for which principal components of motion were calculated, thereby indicating consistent patterns of SC oscillation that can potentially be used to improve SC imaging.},

We hypothesize that a "presyrinx" condition attributable to a potentially reversible alteration in normal CSF flow exists and that its appearance may be caused by variations in the competence of the central canal of the spinal cord. METHODS: Five patients with clinical evidence of myelopathy, no history of spinal cord trauma, enlargement of the cervical spinal cord with T1 and T2 prolongation but no cavitation, evidence of altered or obstructed CSF flow, and no evidence of intramedullary tumor or a spinal vascular event underwent MR imaging before and after intervention that alleviated obstruction to CSF flow. RESULTS: Preoperatively, all patients had enlarged spinal cords and parenchymal T1 and T2 prolongation without cavitation. Results of MR examinations after intervention showed resolution of cord enlargement and normalization or improvement of cord signal abnormalities. In one patient with severe arachnoid adhesions who initially improved after decompression, late evolution into syringomyelia occurred in association with continued CSF obstruction. CONCLUSION: Nontraumatic obstruction of the CSF pathways in the spine may result in spinal cord parenchymal T2 prolongation that is reversible after restoration of patency of CSF pathways. We refer to this MR appearance as the "presyrinx" state and stress the importance of timely intervention to limit progression to syringomyelia.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To highlight a specific under-recognized radiological feature of spondylotic myelopathy often resulting in misdiagnosis. METHODS: Patients evaluated between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2012 who met the following criteria were included: (1) spondylotic myelopathy was suspected, (2) gadolinium enhancement was detected, and (3) spinal surgery was performed. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients (70\% men) whose median age was 53.5 years (range = 24-80) were included. Spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (cervical in 52; thoracic in 4) revealed longitudinal spindle-shaped T2-signal hyperintensity (100\%) and cord enlargement (79\%) accompanied by a characteristic pancakelike transverse band of gadolinium enhancement in 41 (73\%), typically immediately caudal to the site of maximal spinal stenosis. Forty (71\%) patients were initially diagnosed with neoplastic or inflammatory myelopathies, and decompressive surgery was delayed by a median of 11 months (range = 1-64). Spinal cord biopsy in 6 did not reveal any alternative diagnosis. Ninety-five percent were stable or improved. Gadolinium enhancement persisted in 75\% at 12 months, raising concern about the accuracy of the initial diagnosis. Twenty patients required a gait aid (36\%) at last follow-up (median = 60 months, range = 10-172). The need for a gait aid preoperatively (p = 0.005), but not delay of surgery, predicted the need for gait aid at final follow-up. INTERPRETATION: Transverse pancakelike gadolinium enhancement associated with and just caudal to the site of maximal stenosis and at the rostrocaudal midpoint of a spindle-shaped T2 hyperintensity suggests that spondylosis is the cause of the myelopathy. Persistent enhancement for months to years following decompressive surgery is common. Recognition is important to prevent inappropriate interventions or delay in consideration of a potentially beneficial decompressive surgery.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review our experience and examine the size at which aneurysms ruptured in our patient population. METHODS: Patient charts and angiograms for all patients admitted with a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage to the Thomas Jefferson/Wills Eye Hospital between April 1996 and March 2000 were reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 362 cases reviewed, definite measurements of the ruptured aneurysm were obtained in 245. The data clearly showed that most ruptured aneurysms presenting to our institution were less than 10 mm in diameter. We found that, regardless of location on the circle of Willis, 85.6\% of all aneurysms presenting with rupture were less than 10 mm. Review by location shows that aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery most often presented with rupture at sizes less than 10 mm (94.4\%). A large number of ruptured posterior communicating artery aneurysms also presented at sizes less than 10 mm (87.5\%). This trend continued for all aneurysm sites in our review. The incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage in Western countries is estimated at 10 per 100,000 people per year. Recent reports have indicated that aneurysms less than 10 mm in size are unlikely to rupture. CONCLUSION: We argue that the risk of small aneurysms rupturing is not insignificant, especially those of the anterior communicating artery. Our findings indicate that surgery on unruptured aneurysms should not be predicated on aneurysm size alone.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The efficacy of fusion surgery in addition to decompression surgery in patients who have lumbar spinal stenosis, with or without degenerative spondylolisthesis, has not been substantiated in controlled trials. METHODS: We randomly assigned 247 patients between 50 and 80 years of age who had lumbar spinal stenosis at one or two adjacent vertebral levels to undergo either decompression surgery plus fusion surgery (fusion group) or decompression surgery alone (decompression-alone group). Randomization was stratified according to the presence of preoperative degenerative spondylolisthesis (in 135 patients) or its absence. Outcomes were assessed with the use of patient-reported outcome measures, a 6-minute walk test, and a health economic evaluation. The primary outcome was the score on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI; which ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe disability) 2 years after surgery. The primary analysis, which was a per-protocol analysis, did not include the 14 patients who did not receive the assigned treatment and the 5 who were lost to follow-up. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the groups in the mean score on the ODI at 2 years (27 in the fusion group and 24 in the decompression-alone group, P=0.24) or in the results of the 6-minute walk test (397 m in the fusion group and 405 m in the decompression-alone group, P=0.72). Results were similar between patients with and those without spondylolisthesis. Among the patients who had 5 years of follow-up and were eligible for inclusion in the 5-year analysis, there were no significant differences between the groups in clinical outcomes at 5 years. The mean length of hospitalization was 7.4 days in the fusion group and 4.1 days in the decompression-alone group (P{$<$}0.001). Operating time was longer, the amount of bleeding was greater, and surgical costs were higher in the fusion group than in the decompression-alone group. During a mean follow-up of 6.5 years, additional lumbar spine surgery was performed in 22\% of the patients in the fusion group and in 21\% of those in the decompression-alone group. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, with or without degenerative spondylolisthesis, decompression surgery plus fusion surgery did not result in better clinical outcomes at 2 years and 5 years than did decompression surgery alone.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the effect, if any, of instrumentation on the outcome of lumbar fusion surgery, according to reports of the patients, and whether there is a correlation between the radiographic determination of a solid fusion and the same patient-reported outcome. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The literature on this topic reports pseudarthrosis rates from 0\% to 57\% and good to excellent results from 56\% to 95\%. These studies provide no clear-cut recommendations concerning the effect of added lumbar instrumentation on patient-reported outcome in a prospective manner using concurrent control subjects. METHODS: The patients were randomized to groups with and without instrumentation after deciding to undergo a lumbar fusion and consenting to enter the study. Radiographs were obtained and questionnaires filled out at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in patient-reported outcome between the two groups. There was a slight nonsignificant trend toward increased radiographic fusion rate in the group with instrumentation that did not correlate with an increased patient-reported improvement rate.

OBJECTIVES: To examine associations between radiographic parameters (scoliosis and olisthesis) and outcomes of surgery for degenerative spinal stenosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Preoperative degenerative scoliosis generally is thought to be associated with an unfavorable outcome of surgery for spinal stenosis. Data on the relationship between an increase in olisthesis after laminectomy for spinal stenosis and outcomes of surgery are sparse and conflicting. METHODS: Radiographs were obtained before surgery and at least 6 months after surgery and coded for preoperative scoliosis and change in olisthesis after surgery. The reviewers of radiographs were blind to outcome information. Patients completed questionnaires on demographic and clinical data as well as on back pain, lower extremity pain, walking capacity, and satisfaction with surgery. Associations between radiographic data and patient reported outcomes were examined with the Spearman rank correlation and confirmed with multiple linear regression models that adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Ninety patients met eligibility criteria. Preoperative scoliosis was associated with less improvement in back pain at 6 months and at 24 months after surgery. An increase in olisthesis after surgery was associated with greater improvement in lower extremity pain at 6 months and at 24 months after surgery. An increase in olisthesis also was associated with greater improvement in walking capacity at 6 months and at 24 months after surgery. In multivariable analyses that adjusted for potential confounders, a change in olisthesis was not associated significantly with greater improvement in any of the outcomes. CONCLUSION: The data support the widely held view that preoperative scoliosis is associated with an unfavorable outcome after decompression for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. Increase in olisthesis was not associated with unfavorable results. In fact, there was a weak trend toward better outcomes with greater slip. These data indicate that minor increases in olisthesis after surgery for spinal stenosis generally are tolerated well.},

OBJECTIVES: To examine associations between radiographic parameters (scoliosis and olisthesis) and outcomes of surgery for degenerative spinal stenosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Preoperative degenerative scoliosis generally is thought to be associated with an unfavorable outcome of surgery for spinal stenosis. Data on the relationship between an increase in olisthesis after laminectomy for spinal stenosis and outcomes of surgery are sparse and conflicting. METHODS: Radiographs were obtained before surgery and at least 6 months after surgery and coded for preoperative scoliosis and change in olisthesis after surgery. The reviewers of radiographs were blind to outcome information. Patients completed questionnaires on demographic and clinical data as well as on back pain, lower extremity pain, walking capacity, and satisfaction with surgery. Associations between radiographic data and patient reported outcomes were examined with the Spearman rank correlation and confirmed with multiple linear regression models that adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Ninety patients met eligibility criteria. Preoperative scoliosis was associated with less improvement in back pain at 6 months and at 24 months after surgery. An increase in olisthesis after surgery was associated with greater improvement in lower extremity pain at 6 months and at 24 months after surgery. An increase in olisthesis also was associated with greater improvement in walking capacity at 6 months and at 24 months after surgery. In multivariable analyses that adjusted for potential confounders, a change in olisthesis was not associated significantly with greater improvement in any of the outcomes. CONCLUSION: The data support the widely held view that preoperative scoliosis is associated with an unfavorable outcome after decompression for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis.

  abstract = {Low back pain (LBP), a highly prevalent problem in society, is often a recurrent condition. Recent advances in the understanding of the biomechanics of LBP have highlighted the importance of muscular stabilization of the "neutral zone" range of motion in the low back. The lumbar multifidus muscles (LMM) are important stabilizers of this neutral zone, and dysfunction in these muscles is strongly associated with LBP. The dysfunction is a result of pain inhibition from the spine, and it tends to continue even after the pain has resolved, likely contributing to the high recurrence rate of LBP. Persisting LMM dysfunction is identified by atrophic replacement of multifidus muscle with fat, a condition that is best seen on magnetic resonance imaging. Muscle training directed at teaching patients to activate their LMM is an important feature of any clinical approach to the LBP patient with demonstrated LMM dysfunction or atrophy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In symptomatic Chiari malformation type 1 (CMI), impaired intracranial compliance (ICC) is associated with an increased cranio-spinal pulsatile pressure gradient. Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents a non-invasive modality for the assessment of the pulse pressure gradient at the cranio-cervical junction (CCJ). We wished to explore how the MRI-derived pulse pressure gradient (MRI-dP) compares with invasively measured pulsatile intracranial pressure (ICP) in CMI, and with healthy controls. METHODS: From phase-contrast MRI of CMI patients and healthy controls, we computed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow velocities and MRI-dP at the CCJ. We assessed bidirectional flow and compared the flow between the anterior and the posterior subarachnoid space at the CCJ. We computed total intracranial volume (ICV), ventricular CSF volume (VV), and posterior cranial fossa volume (PCFV). We analyzed the static and pulsatile ICP scores from overnight monitoring in CMI patients. RESULTS: Five CMI patients and four healthy subjects were included. The CMI group had a significantly larger extent of tonsillar ectopia, smaller PCFV, and a smaller area of CSF in the FM. The pulsatile ICP (mean ICP wave amplitude, MWA) was abnormally increased in 4/5 CMI patients and correlated positively with MRI-dP. However, the MRI-dP as well as the CSF flow velocities did not differ significantly between CMI and healthy subjects. Moreover, bidirectional flow was observed in both CMI as well as healthy subjects, with no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: In symptomatic CMI patients, we found a significant association between the pulse pressure gradient at the CCJ derived from phase-contrast MRI and the pulsatile ICP (MWA) measured invasively. However, the MRI-dP was close to identical in CMI patients and healthy subjects. Moreover, the CSF flow velocities at the CCJ and the occurrence of bidirectional flow were not different in CMI patients and healthy individuals. Further studies are required to determine the diagnostic role of phase-contrast MRI in CMI patients.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate short-term radiological changes in sagittal alignment after lumbar decompression without fusion for lumbar canal stenosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although the importance of global sagittal balance is underscored recently, little is known about the changes in sagittal alignment after lumbar canal decompression. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 88 patients who underwent lumbar decompression without fusion at a single institution between November 2008 and May 2013, with a minimum follow-up of 5 months. Standing radiographs at the preoperative period and the final follow-up were assessed. Radiological parameters included the sagittal vertical axis (SVA), lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic tilt, pelvic incidence (PI), occipital 7th cervical angle, and thoracic kyphosis, which were measured by 2 spine surgeons. The Zurich Claudication Questionnaire and visual analogue scale scores were obtained to assess the patient-based clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Both LL and thoracic kyphosis significantly increased postoperatively, whereas SVA, PI-LL (PI minus LL), and pelvic tilt significantly decreased (P{$<$}0.05). There were no significant differences between the preoperative and postoperative occipital 7th cervical angle and PI. The amount of increment in LL was greater in patients with small preoperative LL. The improvement in SVA was greater in those with a large preoperative SVA. The Zurich Claudication Questionnaire and visual analogue scale scores showed no significant correlation with the radiological parameters. CONCLUSION: Lumbar decompression without fusion can induce a reactive improvement in the lumbar and global sagittal alignment even if a sagittal imbalance exists preoperatively.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the correlation between the K-line-based classification of cervical OPLL patients and their surgical outcome. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies showed that kyphotic alignment of the cervical spine and a large OPLL are major factors causing poor surgical outcome after laminoplasty for cervical OPLL patients. However, no report has evaluated these 2 factors in 1 parameter. METHODS: The K-line was defined as a line that connects the midpoints of the spinal canal at C2 and C7. Twenty-seven patients who had cervical OPLL and underwent posterior decompression surgery were classified into 2 groups according to their K-line classification. OPLL did not exceed the K-line in the K-line (+) group and did exceed it in the K-line (-) group. By intraoperative ultrasonography, we evaluated the posterior shift of the spinal cord after the posterior decompression procedure. The Japanese Orthopedic Association scores before surgery and 1 year after surgery were evaluated, and the recovery rate was calculated. RESULTS: Eight patients were classified as K-line (-), and 19 patients were classified as K-line (+). The mean recovery rate was 13.9\% in the K-line (-) group and 66.0\% in the K-line (+) group (P {$<$} 0.01). Ultrasonography showed that the posterior shift of the spinal cord was insufficient in the K-line (-) group. CONCLUSION: The present results demonstrate that a sufficient posterior shift of the spinal cord and neurologic improvement will not be obtained after posterior decompression surgery in the K-line (-) group. Our new index, the K-line, is a simple and practical tool for making decisions regarding the surgical approach for cervical OPLL patients.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results of surgical treatments for SEACs and to clarify features of the disease associated with poor outcomes. METHODS: Twelve patients with SEACs who underwent surgery at our hospital between 1988 and 2008 were examined retrospectively. The mean follow-up period was 4.7 years. Total resection of the cyst was performed in 7 patients and closure of the dural defect without cyst resection in 5 patients. Surgical outcomes were evaluated with regard to the duration of symptoms, the size of the cyst, and the surgical procedure used. RESULTS: Neurological recovery was observed in all patients, and there was no recurrence. Poor outcomes were observed in patients with a long duration of symptoms ({$>$}1 year, P {$<$} .01) and large cyst size ({$>$}5 vertebrae, P {$<$} .05). The surgical procedure had no significant association with the postoperative neurological recovery. However, there was a significant difference in the degree of the mean postoperative kyphotic angle between the patients treated by total resection of the cyst (9.7 degrees) and those treated by closure of the dural defect without cyst resection through selective laminectomy (2.2 degrees) (P {$<$} .01). CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in postoperative neurological recovery between the 2 surgical procedures. However, closure of the dural defect without cyst resection was less invasive, preventing postoperative kyphotic deformity of the thoracolumbar spine.},

  abstract = {Background context Most spine patient-reported outcome measures are divided into neck and back subregions. This prevents their use in the assessment of the whole spine. By contrast, whole-spine patient-reported outcome measures assess the spine from cervical to lumbar as a single kinetic chain. However, existing whole-spine patient-reported outcomes have been critiqued for clinimetric limitations, including concerns with practicality. Purpose To develop the Spine Functional Index (SFI) as a new whole-spine patient-reported outcome measure that addressed the limitations of existing whole-spine questionnaires; and to determine the SFI's clinimetric and practical characteristics concurrently with a recognized criterion, the Functional Rating Index (FRI). Study design Observational cohort study within 10 physical therapy outpatient clinics. Patient sample Spine-injured patients were recruited from a convenience sample referred by a medical practitioner to physical therapy. A pilot study (n=52, 57\% female, age 47.6{$\pm$}17.5 years) followed by the main study (n=203, 48\% female, age 41.0{$\pm$}17.8 years) that had an average symptom duration of less than 5 weeks. Outcome measures Spine Functional Index, FRI, and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Methods The SFI was developed through three stages: 1) item generation, 2) item reduction with an expert panel and patient focus group, and 3) pilot field testing to provide provisional clinimetric properties and sample size requirements and to determine suitability for a larger study. Participants completed the SFI, FRI, and NRS every 2 weeks for 6 weeks, then every 4 weeks until discharge or study completion at 6 months. Responses were assessed to provide individual psychometric and practical characteristics for both patient-reported outcomes, with the overall performance evaluated by the Measurement of Outcome Measures and Bot clinimetric assessment scales. Results The SFI demonstrated a high criterion validity with the FRI (Pearson r=0.87, 95\% confidence interval [CI]), equivalent internal consistency ({$\alpha$}=0.91), and a single-factor structure. The SFI and FRI demonstrated suitable reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient2,1=0.97:0.95), responsiveness (standardized response mean=1.81:1.68), minimal detectable change with 90\% CI (6.4\%:9.7\%), Flesch scale reading ease (64\%:47\%), and user errors (1.5\%:5.3\%). The clinimetric performance was higher for the SFI on the Measurement of Outcome Measures (96\%:64\%) and on the Bot scale (100\%:75\%). Conclusions The SFI demonstrated sound clinimetric properties with lower response errors, efficient completion and scoring, and improved responsiveness and overall clinimetric performance compared with the FRI. These results indicated that the SFI was suitable for functional outcome measurement of the whole spine in both the research and clinical settings.},

The three subtypes of this condition all manifest some variation of a pars interarticularis defect as a result of recurrent injury to that structure. A multifactorial origin is postulated for this disease; mechanical, hereditary, and hormonal factors are believed to play a role. Presenting signs and symptoms may include those referable to neurological compromise or those related to the spinal deformity. The majority of patients with spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis respond to conservative, nonoperative treatment. Pain, neurological compromise, and cosmetic defects unresponsive to traditional therapies may require surgical intervention. Surgical options include any combination of the following: neural decompression, bone fusion, instrument-assisted fusion, and reduction.

Historically, midline ventral IDEM tumors are ostensibly thought to be unfavorable candidates for removal through a direct posterior approach. A case report of a patient with a ventrally based centrally located meningioma in the upper cervical spine (C2/C3) that was removed with direct posterior approach is described. Case presentation: A 51-year-old male presented with cervicalgia and radiating scapular pain following a remote motor vehicle collision. A ventrally located meningioma in relation to the C2 body was noted on MRI. Management of this patient included obtaining adequate exposure through a posterior approach, complete tumor excision, and maintenance of cervical spine stability. Cervical stability was maintained following total unilateral facetectomy and application of instrumentation from C1-C3. Discussion: Subsequent to tumor removal, the patient had complete resolution of his cervicalgia, headaches, and scapular pain by his two month follow-up appointment. Although adhesions can make total resection difficult, a posterior approach can grant adequate access to midline ventral meningiomas. Cervical spine stability, tumor location, infection risk, and surgeon familiarity with the approach should all be weighed in decision-making.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A primary concern after posterior lumbar spine arthrodesis is the potential for adjacent segment degeneration cephalad or caudad to the fusion segment. There is controversy regarding the subsequent degeneration of adjacent segments, and we are aware of no long-term studies that have analyzed both cephalad and caudad degeneration following posterior arthrodesis. A retrospective investigation was performed to determine the rates of degeneration and survival of the motion segments adjacent to the site of a posterior lumbar fusion. METHODS: Two hundred and fifteen patients who had undergone posterior lumbar arthrodesis were included in this study. The study group included 126 female patients and eighty-nine male patients. The average duration of follow-up was 6.7 years. Radiographs were analyzed with regard to arthritic degeneration at the adjacent levels both preoperatively and at the time of the last follow-up visit. Disc spaces were graded on a 4-point arthritic degeneration scale. Correlation analysis was used to determine the contribution of independent variables to the rate of degeneration. Survivorship analysis was performed to describe the degeneration of the adjacent motion segments. RESULTS: Fifty-nine (27.4\%) of the 215 patients had evidence of degeneration at the adjacent levels and elected to have an additional decompression (fifteen patients) or arthrodesis (forty-four patients). Kaplan-Meier analysis predicted a disease-free survival rate of 83.5\% (95\% confidence interval, 77.5\% to 89.5\%) at five years and of 63.9\% (95\% confidence interval, 54.0\% to 73.8\%) at ten years after the index operation. Although there was a trend toward progression of the arthritic grade at the adjacent disc levels, there was no significant correlation, with the numbers available, between the preoperative arthritic grade and the need for additional surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of symptomatic degeneration at an adjacent segment warranting either decompression or arthrodesis was predicted to be 16.5\% at five years and 36.1\% at ten years. There appeared to be no correlation with the length of fusion or the preoperative arthritic degeneration of the adjacent segment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The comparative effectiveness of performing instrumented (rigid pedicle screws affixed to titanium alloy rods) lumbar spinal fusion in addition to decompressive laminectomy in patients with symptomatic lumbar grade I degenerative spondylolisthesis with spinal stenosis is unknown. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled trial, we assigned patients, 50 to 80 years of age, who had stable degenerative spondylolisthesis (degree of spondylolisthesis, 3 to 14 mm) and symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis to undergo either decompressive laminectomy alone (decompression-alone group) or laminectomy with posterolateral instrumented fusion (fusion group). The primary outcome measure was the change in the physical-component summary score of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36; range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life) 2 years after surgery. The secondary outcome measure was the score on the Oswestry Disability Index (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more disability related to back pain). Patients were followed for 4 years. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients (mean age, 67 years; 80\% women) underwent randomization. The rate of follow-up was 89\% at 1 year, 86\% at 2 years, and 68\% at 4 years. The fusion group had a greater increase in SF-36 physical-component summary scores at 2 years after surgery than did the decompression-alone group (15.2 vs. 9.5, for a difference of 5.7; 95\% confidence interval, 0.1 to 11.3; P=0.046). The increases in the SF-36 physical-component summary scores in the fusion group remained greater than those in the decompression-alone group at 3 years and at 4 years (P=0.02 for both years). With respect to reductions in disability related to back pain, the changes in the Oswestry Disability Index scores at 2 years after surgery did not differ significantly between the study groups (-17.9 in the decompression-alone group and -26.3 in the fusion group, P=0.06). More blood loss and longer hospital stays occurred in the fusion group than in the decompression-alone group (P{$<$}0.001 for both comparisons). The cumulative rate of reoperation was 14\% in the fusion group and 34\% in the decompression-alone group (P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with degenerative grade I spondylolisthesis, the addition of lumbar spinal fusion to laminectomy was associated with slightly greater but clinically meaningful improvement in overall physical health-related quality of life than laminectomy alone.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Morphometric analysis or examination of symptoms in patients with Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) with various associations does not suffice for evaluation of surgical outcome of these patients. We assessed the relationship of morphologic changes in brain and spinal cord and disease symptoms with changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrodynamic parameters in patients with CM-I. METHODS: The study included 41 patients in 3 groups of~CM-I, CM-I/occipitoatlantoaxial joint instability, and CM-I/tethered cord syndrome and 18 normal subjects. Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging and computational fluid dynamics analysis were done for all samples. RESULTS: Maximum CSF velocities and pressures in patients had an increase of 17.1\%-23.2\% and 41.5\%-56.8\%, respectively, compared with normal subjects. The data dispersion of maximum CSF velocity was {$>$}3.1 times that of the maximum pressure. Results showed that maximum CSF pressure is a more appropriate hydrodynamic parameter than maximum CSF velocity for assessing the condition of patients. Results also showed that CSF and PCF volumes had declined 57\% and 11.3\%, respectively, in CM-I. These declines were greater in CM-I than in the other 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Maximum CSF pressure regardless of the group the patients belonged to was similar in patients with symptoms of similar intensity. The correlation between maximum CSF pressure with CSF and PCF volumes decreased secondary to the disease. PCF volume was more favorable than CSF volume for assessing intensity of disease symptoms. Furthermore, in a constant pressure change, sensitivity of PCF volume in CM-I/occipitoatlantoaxial joint instability and CM-I/tethered cord syndrome groups was more than in the CM-I group.},

Transecting the vagus nerve results in significant morbidity, and attempts at nerve preservation should be made whenever possible. We introduce a nerve-sparing technique using meticulous microsurgical dissection and intraoperative nerve monitoring for vagal schwannomas. A 61-year old patient presented with an enlarging 2-cm right vagal nerve schwannoma. She underwent resection via a transcervical approach. The patient was intubated with an electromyographic (EMG) endotracheal tube that allowed for monitoring of the recurrent laryngeal nerve intraoperatively. A microsurgical subcapsular dissection was performed after branches of the vagus nerve were identified using a nerve probe and preserved. At the conclusion of the resection the nerve was intact and stimulated along its entire course. Postoperatively, the patient had normal vagal nerve function. We introduced the role of intraoperative nerve monitoring using an EMG endotracheal tube for successful enucleation of vagal schwannomas. In conjunction with meticulous microsurgical dissection, nerve monitoring allows for successful preservation of the vagus nerve and decreased postoperative morbidity.},

It is obvious, even in this small series, that as the disc degenerates, forward displacement occurs; however, once the disc collapses, further displacement does not occur. The study also revealed that forward displacement does not necessarily cause symptoms.

Patients with positive sagittal balance (N = 352) were further evaluated regarding radiographic parameters and health status measures, including the Scoliosis Research Society patient questionnaire, MOS short form-12, and Oswestry Disability Index. OBJECTIVES: To examine patients with adult deformity with positive sagittal balance to define parameters within that group that might differentially predict clinical impact. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In a multicenter study of 298 adults with spinal deformity, positive sagittal balance was identified as the radiographic parameter most highly correlated with adverse health status outcomes. METHODS: Radiographic evaluation was performed according to a standardized protocol for 36-inch standing radiographs. Magnitude of positive sagittal balance and regional sagittal Cobb angle measures were recorded. Statistical correlation between radiographic parameters and health status measures were performed. Potentially confounding variables were assessed. RESULTS: Positive sagittal balance was identified in 352 patients. The C7 plumb line deviation ranged from 1 to 271 mm. All measures of health status showed significantly poorer scores as C7 plumb line deviation increased. Patients with relative kyphosis in the lumbar region had significantly more disability than patients with normal or lordotic lumbar sagittal Cobb measures. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that although even mildly positive sagittal balance is somewhat detrimental, severity of symptoms increases in a linear fashion with progressive sagittal imbalance. The results also show that kyphosis is more favorable in the upper thoracic region but very poorly tolerated in the lumbar spine.},

METHODS: Between 1988 and 2001, 160 patients with atlantoaxial instability were treated with the use of a plate and screw method of fixation at the Department of Neurosurgery at King Edward Memorial Hospital in Bombay, India. The study group was composed of 91 males and 69 females (mean age, 23 yr; age range, 18 mo-79 yr). Atlantoaxial instability was a result of congenital abnormality in 132 patients (83\%) and occurred after trauma in 28 patients (17\%). All patients had mobile, completely reducible atlantoaxial dislocation. For 3 months postoperatively, a hard cervical collar was used. The mean follow-up period was 42 months (range, 4 mo-14 yr). RESULTS: Three patients died in the postoperative phase. Successful stabilization of the atlantoaxial region was documented with dynamic radiography in the other 157 patients. There was no incidence of implant rejection. In one patient, one screw was found to be broken 18 months after surgery; however, firm bony fusion was documented in this patient. There were no neurological, vascular, or infective complications. CONCLUSION: The plate and screw method of fixation with the use of intra-articular bone grafts in patients with atlantoaxial instability yielded a 100\% fusion rate with a low incidence of complications.},

METHODS: Twenty-two patients with basilar invagination-in which the odontoid process invaginated into the foramen magnum and the tip of the odontoid process was above the Chamberlain, McRae foramen magnum, and Wackenheim clival lines-were selected to undergo surgery. In all patients fixed atlantoaxial dislocations were documented. The 16 male and six female patients ranged in age from 8 to 50 years. A history of trauma prior to the onset of symptoms was documented in 17 patients. Following surgery, the author observed minimal-to-significant reduction of basilar invagination and alteration in other craniospinal parameters resulting in restoration of alignment of the tip of the odontoid process and the clivus and the entire craniovertebral junction in all patients. In addition to neurological and radiological improvement, preoperative symptoms of torticollis resolved significantly in all patients. The minimum follow-up period was 12 months and the mean was 28 months. CONCLUSIONS: Joint distraction and firm lateral mass fixation in selected cases of basilar invagination is a reasonable surgical treatment for reducing the basilar invagination, restoring craniospinal alignment, and establishing fixation of the atlantoaxial joint.},

Bone graft that is additionally placed within the appropriately prepared atlantoaxial joint and posterior to the arch of atlas and lamina of C2 provides bony fusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2002 and April 2007, 11 patients underwent the discussed method of fixation at the Department of Neurosurgery, King Edward Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, India. All 11 patients had "congenital" basilar invagination and the symptoms were progressive in nature. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 21 months (range 8-40 months). Neurological improvement and successful distraction with atlantoaxial stabilization and ultimate bone fusion was achieved in all the patients and was documented with dynamic radiography. There were no neurological, vascular, or infective complications. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the described method of atlantoaxial joint distraction and fixation provides an alternative treatment strategy for cases with basilar invagination. "Joint distraction" as a stand-alone method could provide reduction of basilar invagination and firm stabilization in such cases.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: This study is a retrospective analysis of 60 surgically treated patients with 64 peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) at the second cervical (C-2) nerve root. The anatomical subtleties of these tumors and their implications for surgical strategy when compared with other spinal PNSTs and other tumors in the foramen magnum region are reviewed. METHODS: Sixty patients with C-2 PNSTs treated surgically in the Department of Neurosurgery at King Edward VII Memorial Hospital and Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College between 1992 and 2006 were studied. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Tumors were divided into 3 groups depending on their anatomical location identified during surgery. Those tumors located within or extending into the spinal dural tube were called Type A, those located within the dural tube of the C-2 ganglion were labeled as Type B, and tumors extending laterally into the paraspinal region were labeled as Type C. Follow-up durations ranged from 6 months to 15 years (mean 64 months). RESULTS: There were 38 male and 22 female patients in the study, who ranged in age from 6 to 62 years (mean 28 years). Nine patients had clinical features indicative of neurofibromatosis (NF). The mean duration of symptoms at the time of presentation was 27 months (range 4 days-5 years). Two patients had no specific symptoms related to the C-2 PNST, 6 patients had only local symptoms such as neck pain or stiffness, and 52 patients had symptoms of varying degrees of myelopathy. There were 5 solely Type A tumors, 7 Type A + B tumors, 31 Type B tumors, and 21 Type B + C tumors. All Type A, A + B, and B tumors were totally resected. Seven of 21 Type B + C tumors were partially resected, and the remainder were completely resected. All patients postoperatively reported varying improvement in their preoperative symptoms. Except for patients with NF who were disabled by other tumors, the rest of the patients resumed their normal life style. There have been no cases of symptomatic tumor recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of PNSTs located at the C-2 level in these patients probably arose from the large C-2 ganglion and are limited within the dural confines or are interdural in location. In contrast to other spinal PNSTs, the location of C-2 PNSTs is in most cases posterior to the lateral mass of the atlas and axis and the atlantoaxial joint and is exposed to the posterior without any bone cover. Radical tumor resection is safe, resolution of clinical symptoms is rapid, and recurrence rates are extremely low. In a selected number of cases, bone work for tumor exposure and resection can be entirely avoided.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with surgery in 50 patients with C2 neurinomas. The anatomic subtleties of these discrete forms of tumors and their surgical implications are analyzed. METHODS: During the period 2006-2016, we operated on 50 patients with 55 C2 neurinomas. Type A tumors were located within the spinal canal, type B tumors were located in the lateral gutter, and type C tumors had a paraspinal extension. By working within the dural confines of the tumor and appropriately angulating the microscope, the entire tumor bulk extending into 1 or all 3 compartments was resected. Follow-up duration ranged from 3 months to 10 years (mean 68 months). RESULTS: This series included 36 male and 14 female patients. Age range of patients was 14-70 years (mean age 36 years). Progressive symptoms of myelopathy were present in 41 patients. There were 16 type A~+ B tumors, 27 type B tumors, 10 type B~+ C tumors, and 2 type A~+ B~+ C tumors. All patients experienced symptom improvement after surgery and were able to resume their normal lifestyle. CONCLUSIONS: C2 neurinomas arise in the region of the C2 ganglion, and despite the fact that some achieve a large size, they remain confined within the dura. Radical tumor resection can be achieved by working within the layers of the dural cover. Bone removal and opening of spinal dura for tumor exposure and resection can be avoided.},

  abstract = {Object. Anterior approaches to the spine for the treatment of spinal tumors have gained acceptance; however, in most published reports, patients with primary, metastatic, or chest wall tumors involving cervical, thoracic, or lumbar regions of the spine are combined. The purpose of this study was to provide a clear perspective of results that can be expected in patients who undergo anterior vertebral body resection, reconstruction, and stabilization for spinal metastases that are limited to the thoracic region. Methods. Outcome is presented for 72 patients with metastatic spinal tumors who were treated by transthoracic vertebrectomy at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. The predominant primary tumors included renal cancer in 19 patients, breast cancer in 10, melanoma or sarcoma in 10, and lung cancer in nine patients. The most common presenting symptoms were back pain, which occurred in 90\% of patients, and lower-extremity weakness, which occurred in 64\% of patients. All patients underwent transthoracic vertebrectomy, decompression, reconstruction with methylmethacrylate, and anterior fixation with locking plate and screw constructs. Supplemental posterior instrumentation was required in seven patients with disease involving the cervicothoracic or thoracolumbar junction, which was causing severe kyphosis. After surgery, pain improved in 60 of 65 patients. This improvement was found to be statistically significant (p {$<$} 0.001) based on visual analog scales and narcotic analgesic medication use. Thirty-five of the 46 patients who presented with neurological dysfunction improved significantly (p {$<$} 0.001) following the procedure. Thirty-three patients had weakness but could ambulate preoperatively. Seventeen of these 33 regained normal strength, 15 patients continued to have weakness, and one patient was neurologically worse postoperatively. Of the 13 preoperatively nonambulatory patients, 10 could walk after surgery and three were still unable to walk but showed improved motor function. Twenty-one patients had complications ranging from minor atelectasis to pulmonary embolism. The 30-day mortality rate was 3\%. The 1-year survival rate for the entire study population was 62\%. Conclusions. These results suggest that transthoracic vertebrectomy and spinal stabilization can improve the quality of life considerably in cancer patients with spinal metastasis by restoring or preserving ambulation and by controlling intractable spinal pain with acceptable rates of morbidity and mortality.},

According to the literature, approximately 8\% of intradural schwannomas occur in the atlantoaxial spine, and these tumors are usually located in the posterolateral or lateral spinal cord. In contrast, tumors in the ventral midline of the spinal cord are relatively rare. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 47-year-old female presented with progressively worsening neck pain and paresthesias in both upper and lower limbs for the past 5 years. DIAGNOSIS: Based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging and histopathological findings, she was diagnosed with ventral midline primary schwannoma of the cervical spinal cord. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with surgical resection. OUTCOMES: Follow-up visit at 2 years after the surgery showed that the patient is neurologically intact and free of disease. CONLUSION: In summary, for the tumors in the ventral midline of the atlantoaxial spinal cord, the preferred treatment is complete surgical resection by the posterior approach compared to the anterior approach, which often improves clinical symptoms or achieves a healing effect.},

  abstract = {The pathophysiology of syringomyelia development is not fully understood. Current prevailing theories suggest that increased pulse pressure in the subarachnoid space forces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the spinal cord into the syrinx. It is generally accepted that the syrinx consists of CSF. The here-proposed intramedullary pulse pressure theory instead suggests that syringomyelia is caused by increased pulse pressure in the spinal cord and that the syrinx consists of extracellular fluid. A new principle is introduced implying that the distending force in the production of syringomyelia is a relative increase in pulse pressure in the spinal cord compared to that in the nearby subarachnoid space. The formation of a syrinx then occurs by the accumulation of extracellular fluid in the distended cord. A previously unrecognized mechanism for syrinx formation, the Bernoulli theorem, is also described. The Bernoulli theorem or the Venturi effect states that the regional increase in fluid velocity in a narrowed flow channel decreases fluid pressure. In Chiari I malformations, the systolic CSF pulse pressure and downward motion of the cerebellar tonsils are significantly increased. This leads to increased spinal CSF velocities and, as a consequence of the Bernoulli theorem, decreased fluid pressure in narrow regions of the spinal CSF pathways. The resulting relatively low CSF pressure in the narrowed CSF pathway causes a suction effect on the spinal cord that distends the cord during each systole. Syringomyelia develops by the accumulation of extracellular fluid in the distended cord. In posttraumatic syringomyelia, the downwards directed systolic CSF pulse pressure is transmitted and reflected into the spinal cord below and above the traumatic subarachnoid blockage, respectively. The ensuing increase in intramedullary pulse pressure distends the spinal cord and causes syringomyelia on both sides of the blockage. The here-proposed concept has the potential to unravel the riddle of syringomyelia and affords explanations to previously unanswered clinical and theoretical problems with syringomyelia. It also explains why syringomyelia associated with Chiari I malformations may develop in any part of the spinal cord including the medullary conus. Syringomyelia thus preferentially develops where the systolic CSF flow causes a suction effect on the spinal cord, i.e., at or immediately caudal to physiological or pathological encroachments of the spinal subarachnoid space.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The decision of whether to treat incidental intracranial saccular aneurysms is complicated by limitations in current knowledge of their natural history. We combined individual patient data from prospective cohort studies to determine predictors of aneurysm rupture and to construct a risk prediction chart to estimate 5-year aneurysm rupture risk by risk factor status. METHODS: We did a systematic review and pooled analysis of individual patient data from 8382 participants in six prospective cohort studies with subarachnoid haemorrhage as outcome. We analysed cumulative rupture rates with Kaplan-Meier curves and assessed predictors with Cox proportional-hazard regression analysis. FINDINGS: Rupture occurred in 230 patients during 29,166 person-years of follow-up. The mean observed 1-year risk of aneurysm rupture was 1{$\cdot$}4\% (95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}1-1{$\cdot$}6) and the 5-year risk was 3{$\cdot$}4\% (2{$\cdot$}9-4{$\cdot$}0). Predictors were age, hypertension, history of subarachnoid haemorrhage, aneurysm size, aneurysm location, and geographical region. In study populations from North America and European countries other than Finland, the estimated 5-year absolute risk of aneurysm rupture ranged from 0{$\cdot$}25\% in individuals younger than 70 years without vascular risk factors with a small-sized ({$<$}7 mm) internal carotid artery aneurysm, to more than 15\% in patients aged 70 years or older with hypertension, a history of subarachnoid haemorrhage, and a giant-sized ({$>$}20 mm) posterior circulation aneurysm. By comparison with populations from North America and European countries other than Finland, Finnish people had a 3{$\cdot$}6-times increased risk of aneurysm rupture and Japanese people a 2{$\cdot$}8-times increased risk. INTERPRETATION: The PHASES score is an easily applicable aid for prediction of the risk of rupture of incidental intracranial aneurysms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six patients with SEAC were enrolled in this retrospective study. Digital subtraction cystography and subsequent CT myelography were performed for every patient. The presence and location of the communicating holes on cystography were documented. We evaluated the MRI characteristics of the cysts, including location, size, and associated spinal cord compression; furthermore, we reviewed cystographic images, CT myelograms, procedural reports, and medical records for analysis. If surgery was performed after cystography, intraoperative findings were compared with preoperative cystography. RESULTS: The location of the communicating hole between the arachnoid cyst and the subarachnoid space was identified by digital subtraction cystography in all cases (n = 6). Surgical resection of SEAC was performed in 4 patients, and intraoperative location of the communicating hole exactly corresponded to the preoperative identification. CONCLUSION: Fluoroscopic-guided cystography for SEAC accurately demonstrates the presence and location of dural defects. Preoperative digital subtraction cystography is useful for detection of a communicating hole between a cyst and the subarachnoid space.},

Tailoring the treatment to the severity of the symptoms and the deformity appears to be vital. Full understanding of the deformity in the coronal and sagittal planes as well as the neural impingement can guide one to the appropriate intervention. The first operation is critical in providing the best prognosis for the long term. Decompression alone is performed in patients with small magnitudes of scoliosis and minimal lateral listhesis. Decompression and posterior fusion with instrumentation is performed on patients with moderate deformity and lateral listhesis, but a balanced sagittal plane. The more technically challenging and larger operation, a combined anterior and posterior fusion with instrumentation, is reserved for those patients with not only moderate to severe curves, but also coronal and sagittal imbalance. Performing a smaller operation on these patients may not only be short-lived but may also start a series of higher-risk revisions. There is a distinct lack of studies identifying and documenting the risks, morbidity, and reoperation rates in this patient population as compared with other deformity groups. Treatment of degenerative scoliosis patients presents a challenge that is only growing larger in numbers with the aging population.},

Anterior approaches including multilevel discectomy with fusion or vertebral corpectomy with strut grafting, both with and without instrumentation, have enjoyed successful outcomes, but have been associated with select postoperative complications. Laminoplasty has been developed to decompress the spine posteriorly while avoiding the spinal destabilization seen after laminectomy. PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to provide a review of the various techniques, biomechanical basis, predictive value of imaging modalities, clinical outcomes, and postoperative complications associated with cervical laminoplasty. STUDY DESIGN: A review of the literature. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review using Medline was performed identifying relevant articles that addressed the techniques, clinical outcomes, and complications after cervical laminoplasty, as well as preoperative radiographic predictors of outcome. RESULTS: The various modifications of cervical laminoplasty have generally been associated with excellent clinical outcomes when used for myelopathy secondary to cervical spondylosis or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). Recent long-term studies have identified issues with this technique including axial neck pain, canal restenosis, nerve root palsy, diminished cervical motion, and loss of cervical lordotic alignment. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical laminoplasty remains a reliable procedure for posterior decompression of the spine, but the optimal approach to cervical myelopathy must take into account both patient and disease characteristics, as well as the capabilities and experience of the surgeon.},

The pressures of the ventricles, syrinx, and cervical subarachnoid space were measured. A complete ventriculosubarachnoid block occurred in the animals with syringomyelia. The baseline syringeal pressures exceeded those of both the ventricles and the subarachnoid space. Raising ventricular pressure elevated the syringeal pressure, but aspiration of ventricular fluid did not acutely lower the pressure. These findings suggest a ventriculosyrinx valve effect that may inflate the syrinx during transient rises of intracranial pressure. A respiratory pressure pattern was found in the syrinx similar to that of the ventricles and subarachnoid space. This wave was reduced but not abolished by ligating the subarachnoid space distal to the syrinx. The arterial pulse was much diminished within the syrinx at rest. These findings indirectly support the possibility that transmission of thoracic pressures to the spinal subarachnoid space with compression of the syrinx is a principal force that enlarges the syrinx.},

OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical outcomes following spinal decompression (Group 1) with those following decompression and instrumented posterolateral fusion (Group 2) and decompression and instrumented posterolateral fusion plus transforaminal interbody fusion (TLIF) (Group 3). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Decompression is frequently advocated for the relief of nerve root stenosis in the presence of degenerate disc disease. It is uncertain if spinal fusion is also necessary. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following completion of a standardized physiotherapy program, 44 patients with single-level disc disease were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 surgical groups. In those patients undergoing instrumentation, segmental pedicle screw fixation was used to stabilize the spine. Titanium interbody cages filled with autologous bone were inserted into patients in Group 3. Spinal disability, quality of life, and pain were assessed before surgery, and then at 1, 2, and 5 years by an independent researcher. RESULTS: At 2 years, 82\% of the patients were pain free or moderately improved. Disability (Low Back Outcome Score and Roland Morris index) were both better in Group 1, but only Low Back Outcome Score was better in Group 2 (P {$<$} 0.05). By 5 years, although patients in all 3 groups showed some improvements in all the ratings used (Low Back Outcome Score, SF-36 Physical Functioning, and Roland Morris score), only Group 1 patients showed significant changes in all 3 outcomes (P {$<$} 0.05). There was no difference in any score between groups (P {$>$} 0.05). Two had secondary surgery for adjacent level stenosis (Group 2 and 3). One patient (Group 1) underwent subsequent lateral mass fusion for chronic pain. No patient required revision surgery for instrumentation failure, cage displacement, or pseudarthrosis. Evidence of at least unilateral lateral mass bone graft incorporation was evident in 95\% of Groups 2 and 3. CONCLUSIONS: The results are encouraging in that almost all patients had improved by 5 years. However, it is a concern that no significant additional benefit has been noted from the more complex surgery. This suggests that patients are optimally treated by decompression alone, with the proviso that further operations may be required.},

OBJECTIVES: A review, analysis, and discussion of the extensive literature on lumbar spinal fusion were done to attempt to place in perspective the indications and success rate for lumbar spinal fusion with and without instrumentation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A wide variety of lumbar spinal conditions have been managed by spinal fusion. Results appear better when the diagnosis is very specific and related to definable instability or deformity in patients with a stable psychologic state. METHODS: Search of literature. RESULTS: Success rates are higher in isthmic spondylolisthesis, unstable spinal stenosis syndromes (degenerative spondylolisthesis, degenerative scoliosis), and in patients with objective segmental instability. Variable success rates are reported for disc-related low back pain conditions and in patients with failed previous surgery. Instrumentation appears to be beneficial in situations where complex deformities or obvious instability is present. When applied for other diagnoses (e.g., internal disc disruption), results appear no better than with traditional surgical techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of lumbar spinal fusion depends on careful assessment of the anatomic cause of pain and of the patient's functional state and expectations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Abnormal flow of CSF through the foramen magnum has been implicated in the pathogenesis of clinical deficits in association with Chiari I malformation. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that peak CSF velocities in the foramen magnum are increased in patients with Chiari I malformations. METHODS: Eight adult patients with symptomatic Chiari I malformations and 10 adult volunteers were studied with cardiac gated, phase-contrast MR imaging in the axial plane at the foramen magnum. The spatial uniformity of flow velocity in the foramen magnum was assessed at 14 time frames within the R-R interval. The velocity in each of the voxels at each of the time frames was calculated, and the peak systolic and diastolic velocities were tabulated for the patients and controls. RESULTS: For the normal volunteers, the CSF velocities in the subarachnoid space were relatively uniform throughout the subarachnoid space at each of the time frames. Peak systolic velocity ranged from 1.2 to 3.3 cm/s, and peak diastolic velocity ranged from 1.6 to 4.5 cm/s. In symptomatic patients with Chiari I, velocities in the foramen magnum did not appear as uniform throughout the subarachnoid space in the phase-contrast images. Peak systolic velocities ranged from 1.8 to 4.8 cm/s, and peak diastolic velocities ranged from 2.5 to 5.3 cm/s. Peak systolic velocity was significantly higher (P =.01) in the patients than in the control volunteers. CONCLUSION: Patients with Chiari I malformations have significant elevations of peak systolic velocity in the CSF in the foramen magnum.},

  abstract = {Spinal deformity affects adults and adolescents in different ways. Adult deformity patients are skeletally mature and tend to have relatively fixed curves, whereas adolescent patients are skeletally immature with flexible curves. As a result, adult patients typically present with back pain and neurological concerns, whereas adolescents present with cosmetic complaints. The goals of surgery on the adult deformity patient are to treat pain and relieve neurological problems while maintaining or achieving three-dimensional balance. The absolute degree of coronal curve correction in an adult deformity patient is less important than maintaining good sagittal balance. Issues that must be addressed in the preoperative decision-making process include the approach to the surgery, the timing of the surgery, and the location of the end of the construct. Twenty years ago, anteroposterior surgery was the most common procedure used for adults with fixed curves; however, recent advances in technology and techniques have led to more frequent use of purely posterior approaches. The posterior approach allows for greater curve correction owing to two major advances in the surgical method: osteotomy techniques, which release fixed deformities, and pedicle screw instrumentation in the thoracolumbar spine, which achieves greater curve correction with fewer levels of fixation. The optimal timing of surgery and the levels to be treated remain open to debate. Each adult patient's treatment must be individualized to achieve the best coronal correction possible while maintaining sagittal balance to preserve the three-dimensional balance of the spine.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Syringomyelia causes progressive myelopathy. Most patients with syringomyelia have a Chiari I malformation of the cerebellar tonsils. Determination of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the progression of syringomyelia associated with the Chiari I malformation should improve strategies to halt progression of myelopathy. METHODS: The authors prospectively studied 20 adult patients with both Chiari I malformation and symptomatic syringomyelia. Testing before surgery included the following: clinical examination; evaluation of anatomy by using T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging; evaluation of the syrinx and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) velocity and flow by using phase-contrast cine MR imaging; and evaluation of lumbar and cervical subarachnoid pressure at rest, during the Valsalva maneuver, during jugular compression, and following removal of CSF (CSF compliance measurement). During surgery, cardiac-gated ultrasonography and pressure measurements were obtained from the intracranial, cervical subarachnoid, and lumbar intrathecal spaces and syrinx. Six months after surgery, clinical examinations, MR imaging studies, and CSF pressure recordings were repeated. Clinical examinations and MR imaging studies were repeated annually. For comparison, 18 healthy volunteers underwent T1-weighted MR imaging, cine MR imaging, and cervical and lumbar subarachnoid pressure testing. Compared with healthy volunteers, before surgery, the patients had decreased anteroposterior diameters of the ventral and dorsal CSF spaces at the foramen magnum. In patients, CSF velocity at the foramen magnum was increased, but CSF flow was reduced. Transmission of intracranial pressure across the foramen magnum to the spinal subarachnoid space in response to jugular compression was partially obstructed. Spinal CSF compliance was reduced, whereas cervical subarachnoid pressure and pulse pressure were increased. Syrinx fluid flowed inferiorly during systole and superiorly during diastole on cine MR imaging. At surgery, the cerebellar tonsils abruptly descended during systole and ascended during diastole, and the upper pole of the syrinx contracted in a manner synchronous with tonsillar descent and with the peak systolic cervical subarachnoid pressure wave. Following surgery, the diameter of the CSF passages at the foramen magnum increased compared with preoperative values, and the maximum flow rate of CSF across the foramen magnum during systole increased. Transmission of pressure across the foramen magnum to the spinal subarachnoid space in response to jugular compression was normal and cervical subarachnoid mean pressure and pulse pressure decreased to normal. The maximum syrinx diameter decreased on MR imaging in all patients. Cine MR imaging documented reduced velocity and flow of the syrinx fluid. Clinical symptoms and signs improved or remained stable in all patients, and the tonsils resumed a normal shape. CONCLUSIONS: The progression of syringomyelia associated with Chiari I malformation is produced by the action of the cerebellar tonsils, which partially occlude the subarachnoid space at the foramen magnum and act as a piston on the partially enclosed spinal subarachnoid space. This creates enlarged cervical subarachnoid pressure waves that compress the spinal cord from without, not from within, and propagate syrinx fluid caudally with each heartbeat, which leads to syrinx progression. The disappearance of the abnormal shape and position of the tonsils after simple decompressive extraarachnoidal surgery suggests that the Chiari I malformation of the cerebellar tonsils is acquired, not congenital. Surgery limited to suboccipital craniectomy, C-I laminectomy, and duraplasty eliminates this mechanism and eliminates syringomyelia and its progression without the risk of more invasive procedures.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The pathogenesis of syringomyelia in patients with an associated spinal lesion is incompletely understood. The authors hypothesized that in primary spinal syringomyelia, a subarachnoid block effectively shortens the length of the spinal subarachnoid space (SAS), reducing compliance and the ability of the spinal theca to dampen the subarachnoid CSF pressure waves produced by brain expansion during cardiac systole. This creates exaggerated spinal subarachnoid pressure waves during every heartbeat that act on the spinal cord above the block to drive CSF into the spinal cord and create a syrinx. After a syrinx is formed, enlarged subarachnoid pressure waves compress the external surface of the spinal cord, propel the syrinx fluid, and promote syrinx progression. METHODS: To elucidate the pathophysiology, the authors prospectively studied 36 adult patients with spinal lesions obstructing the spinal SAS. Testing before surgery included clinical examination; evaluation of anatomy on T1-weighted MRI; measurement of lumbar and cervical subarachnoid mean and pulse pressures at rest, during Valsalva maneuver, during jugular compression, and after removal of CSF (CSF compliance measurement); and evaluation with CT myelography. During surgery, pressure measurements from the SAS above the level of the lesion and the lumbar intrathecal space below the lesion were obtained, and cardiac-gated ultrasonography was performed. One week after surgery, CT myelography was repeated. Three months after surgery, clinical examination, T1-weighted MRI, and CSF pressure recordings (cervical and lumbar) were repeated. Clinical examination and MRI studies were repeated annually thereafter. Findings in patients were compared with those obtained in a group of 18 healthy individuals who had already undergone T1-weighted MRI, cine MRI, and cervical and lumbar subarachnoid pressure testing. RESULTS: In syringomyelia patients compared with healthy volunteers, cervical subarachnoid pulse pressure was increased (2.7 {$\pm$} 1.2 vs 1.6 {$\pm$} 0.6 mm Hg, respectively; p = 0.004), pressure transmission to the thecal sac below the block was reduced, and spinal CSF compliance was decreased. Intraoperative ultrasonography confirmed that pulse pressure waves compressed the outer surface of the spinal cord superior to regions of obstruction of the subarachnoid space. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with the theory that a spinal subarachnoid block increases spinal subarachnoid pulse pressure above the block, producing a pressure differential across the obstructed segment of the SAS, which results in syrinx formation and progression. These findings are similar to the results of the authors' previous studies that examined the pathophysiology of syringomyelia associated with obstruction of the SAS at the foramen magnum in the Chiari Type I malformation and indicate that a common mechanism, rather than different, separate mechanisms, underlies syrinx formation in these two entities.

OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the mechanisms of syringomyelia associated with cerebrospinal fluid pathway obstruction and with intramedullary tumors, contrast transport from the spinal subarachnoid space (SAS) to syrinx was evaluated in syringomyelia patients. METHODS: We prospectively studied patients with syringomyelia: 22 with Chiari I malformation and 16 with SAS obstruction-related syringomyelia before and 1 wk after surgery, and 9 with tumor-related syringomyelia before surgery only. Computed tomography-myelography quantified dye transport into the syrinx before and 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 22 h after contrast injection by measuring contrast density in Hounsfield units (HU). RESULTS: Before surgery, more contrast passed into the syrinx in Chiari I malformation-related syringomyelia and spinal obstruction-related syringomyelia than in tumor-related syringomyelia, as measured by (1) maximum syrinx HU, (2) area under the syrinx concentration-time curve (HU AUC), (3) ratio of syrinx HU to subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; SAS) HU, and (4) AUC syrinx/AUC SAS. More contrast (AUC) accumulated in the syrinx and subarachnoid space before than after surgery. CONCLUSION: Transparenchymal bulk flow of CSF from the subarachnoid space to syrinx occurs in Chiari I malformation-related syringomyelia and spinal obstruction-related syringomyelia. Before surgery, more subarachnoid contrast entered syringes associated with CSF pathway obstruction than with tumor, consistent with syrinx fluid originating from the subarachnoid space in Chiari I malformation and spinal obstruction-related syringomyelia and not from the subarachnoid space in tumor-related syringomyelia. Decompressive surgery opened subarachnoid CSF pathways and reduced contrast entry into syringes associated with CSF pathway obstruction.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anterior communicating artery complex is the most frequent site of intracranial aneurysms in most reported series. Anterior communicating artery aneurysms are the most complex aneurysms of the anterior circulation due to the angioarchitecture and flow dynamics of the ACoA region, frequent anatomical variations, deep interhemispheric location, and danger of severing the perforators with ensuing neurologic deficits. The authors review the practical microsurgical anatomy, importance of preoperative imaging in surgical planning, and microneurosurgical steps in dissection and clipping of ACoAAs. METHODS: This review, and the whole series on intracranial aneurysms, are mainly based on the personal microneurosurgical experience of the senior author (JH) in 2 Finnish centers (Helsinki and Kuopio), which serve, without patient selection, the catchment area in Southern and Eastern Finland. RESULTS: These 2 centers have treated more than 10000 patients with aneurysm since 1951. In the Kuopio Cerebral Aneurysm Database of 3005 patients with 4253 aneurysms, 1145 patients (38\%) had altogether 1179 ACA aneurysms; of them, 898 patients harbored 921 (78\%) ACoAAs. In this series, 715 patients (80\%) presented with ruptured ACoAAs with the median diameter of 7 mm. Giant ACoAAs were present in 15 (2\%), whereas only 3 (0.3\%) were classified as fusiform. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior communicating artery aneurysms present frequently with SAH at small size. Furthermore, unruptured ACoAAs may have increased risk of rupture regardless of size, also as an associated aneurysm, and require treatment. The aim in microneurosurgical management of an ACoAA is total occlusion of the aneurysm sac with preservation of flow in all branching and perforating arteries. This demanding task necessitates perfect surgical strategy based on review of the 3D angioarchitecture and abnormalities of the patient's ACoA complex with its ACoAA and to orientate accordingly during the microsurgical dissection. The surgical trajectory should provide optimal visualization of the ACoA complex without massive brain retraction. Precise dissection in the 3D anatomy of the ACoA complex and perforators requires not only experience and skill but patience to work the dome and base under repeated protection of temporary clips and pilot clips. This is particularly important with the complex, large, and giant aneurysms.},

OBJECTIVES: To investigate, using ultrasound imaging, the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the lumbar multifidus muscle at 4 vertebral levels (L2, L3, L4, L5) in elite cricketers with and without low back pain (LBP) and (2) to document the effect of a staged stabilization training program on multifidus muscle CSA. BACKGROUND: Despite high fitness levels and often intensive strength training programs, athletes still suffer LBP. The incidence of LBP among Australian cricketers is 8\% and as high as 14\% among fast bowlers. Previous researchers have found that the multifidus muscle contributes to segmental stability of the lumbopelvic region; however, the CSA of this muscle has not been previously assessed in elite cricketers. METHODS AND MEASURES: CSAs of the multifidus muscles were assessed at rest on the left and right sides for 4 vertebral levels at the start and completion of a 13-week cricket training camp. Participants who reported current or previous LBP were placed in a rehabilitation group. The stabilization program involved voluntary contraction of the multifidus, transversus abdominis, and pelvic floor muscles, with real-time feedback from rehabilitative ultrasound imaging (RUSI), progressed from non-weight-bearing to weight-bearing positions and movement training. Pain scores (using a visual analogue scale) were also collected from those with LBP. RESULTS: The CSAs of the multifidus muscles at the L5 vertebral level increased for the 7 cricketers with LBP who received the stabilization training, compared with the 14 cricketers without LBP who did not receive rehabilitation (P = .004). In addition, the amount of muscle asymmetry among those with LBP significantly decreased (P = .029) and became comparable to cricketers without LBP. These effects were not evident for the L2, L3, and L4 vertebral levels. There was also a 50\% decrease in the mean reported pain level among the cricketers with LBP. CONCLUSION: Multifidus muscle atrophy can exist in highly active, elite athletes with LBP. Specific retraining resulted in an improvement in multifidus muscle CSA and this was concomitant with a decrease in pain. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapy, level 2b.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The object of this study was to investigate correlations between sagittal spinopelvic alignment and improvements in clinical and quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes after lumbar decompression surgery for lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LCS) without coronal imbalance. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed data from consecutive patients treated for LCS with decompression surgery in the period from 2009 through 2011. They examined correlations between preoperative or postoperative sagittal vertical axis (SVA) and radiological parameters, clinical outcomes, and health-related (HR)QOL scores in patients divided according to SVA. Clinical outcomes were assessed according to Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores. Health-related QOL was evaluated using the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) and the JOA Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire (JOABPEQ). RESULTS: One hundred nine patients were eligible for inclusion in the study. Compared to patients with normal sagittal alignment prior to surgery (Group A: SVA {$<$} 50 mm), those with preoperative sagittal imbalance (Group B: SVA {$\geq$} 50 mm) had significantly smaller lumbar lordosis and thoracic kyphosis angles and larger pelvic tilt. In Group B, there was a significant decrease in postoperative SVA compared with the preoperative SVA (76.3 {$\pm$} 29.7 mm vs. 54.3 {$\pm$} 39.8 mm, p = 0.004). The patients in Group B with severe preoperative sagittal imbalance (SVA {$>$} 80 mm) had residual sagittal imbalance after surgery (82.8 {$\pm$} 41.6 mm). There were no significant differences in clinical and HRQOL outcomes between Groups A and B. Compared to patients with normal postoperative SVA (Group C: SVA {$<$} 50 mm), patients with a postoperative SVA {$\geq$} 50 mm (Group D) had significantly lower JOABPEQ scores, both preoperative and postoperative, for walking ability (preop: 36.6 {$\pm$} 26.3 vs. 22.7 {$\pm$} 26.0, p = 0.038, respectively; postop: 71.1 {$\pm$} 30.4 vs. 42.5 {$\pm$} 29.6, p {$<$} 0.001) and social functioning (preop: 38.7 {$\pm$} 18.5 vs. 30.2 {$\pm$} 16.7, p = 0.045; postop: 67.0 {$\pm$} 25.8 vs. 49.6 {$\pm$} 20.0, p = 0.001), as well as significantly higher postoperative RMDQ (4.9 {$\pm$} 5.2 vs. 7.9 {$\pm$} 5.7, p = 0.015) and VAS scores for low-back pain (2.68 {$\pm$} 2.69 vs. 3.94 {$\pm$} 2.59, p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative sagittal balance was not significantly correlated with clinical or HRQOL outcomes after decompression surgery in LCS patients without coronal imbalance.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The unilateral approach for bilateral decompression was developed as an alternative to laminectomy. Unilateral laminotomy has been rated technically considerably more demanding and associated with more perioperative complications than bilateral laminotomy. Several studies have indicated that bilateral laminotomy are associated with a substantial benefit in most outcome parameters and thus constituted a promising treatment alternative. However, no complete kinematic data and relative biomechanical analysis for evaluating spinal instability treated with unilateral and bilateral laminotomy are available. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the stability of various decompression methods. METHODS: Ten porcine lumbar spines were biomechanically evaluated regarding their strain and range of motion, and the results were compared following unilateral or bilateral laminotomies and laminectomy. The experimental protocol included flexion and extension in the following procedures: intact, unilateral or bilateral laminotomies (L2-L5), and full laminectomy (L2-L5). The spinal segment kinematics was captured using a motion tracking system, and the strain was measured using a strain gauge. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed during flexion and extension between the unilateral and bilateral laminotomies, whereas laminectomy yielded statistically significant findings. Regarding strain, significant differences were observed between the laminectomy and other groups. These results suggest that laminotomy entails higher spinal stability than laminectomy, with no significant differences between bilateral and unilateral laminotomies. CONCLUSIONS: The laminectomy group exhibited more instability, including the index of the range of motion and strain. However, bilateral laminotomy seems to have led to stability similar to that of unilateral laminotomy according to our short-term follow-up. In addition, performing bilateral laminotomies is easier for surgeons than adopting a unilateral approach for bilateral decompression. The results provide recommendations for surgeons regarding final decision making. Future studies conducting long-term evaluation are required.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study of muscle changes after lumbar spinal injury. OBJECTIVES: To investigate effects of intervertebral disc and nerve root lesions on cross-sectional area, histology and chemistry of porcine lumbar multifidus. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The multifidus cross-sectional area is reduced in acute and chronic low back pain. Although chronic changes are widespread, acute changes at 1 segment are identified within days of injury. It is uncertain whether changes precede or follow injury, or what is the mechanism. METHODS: The multifidus cross-sectional area was measured in 21 pigs from L1 to S1 with ultrasound before and 3 or 6 days after lesions: incision into L3-L4 disc, medial branch transection of the L3 dorsal ramus, and a sham procedure. Samples from L3 to L5 were studied histologically and chemically. RESULTS: The multifidus cross-sectional area was reduced at L4 ipsilateral to disc lesion but at L4-L6 after nerve lesion. There was no change after sham or on the opposite side. Water and lactate were reduced bilaterally after disc lesion and ipsilateral to nerve lesion. Histology revealed enlargement of adipocytes and clustering of myofibers at multiple levels after disc and nerve lesions. CONCLUSIONS: These data resolve the controversy that the multifidus cross-sectional area reduces rapidly after lumbar injury. Changes after disc lesion affect 1 level with a different distribution to denervation. Such changes may be due to disuse following reflex inhibitory mechanisms.},

To obtain a deeper insight into the pathophysiology of the Chiari I malformation, we performed a prospective study using axial slices at the level of C2 to analyze volumetric motion data of the spinal cord and CSF over the whole cross-sectional area. METHODS: Eighteen patients with Chiari I malformation and 18 healthy control subjects underwent cardiac-gated phase-contrast imaging. Cross-sectional area measurements and volumetric flow/motion data calculations were made for the following compartments: the entire intradural space, the spinal cord, and the anterior and posterior subarachnoid space. RESULTS: The most striking feature was an increased early systolic caudal and diastolic cranial motion of the spinal cord in the patients. CSF pulsations in the anterior subarachnoid space were unchanged at systole but showed an impaired diastolic upward flow. In the posterior compartment, the CSF systole was slightly shortened, with an impairment of diastolic upward flow. Fourteen of the 18 patients had associated syringeal cavities. This subgroup showed an increased systolic downward displacement of the cord as compared with patients without a syrinx.

On magnetic resonance imaging, schwannomas often exhibit a split fat sign and a target sign. The typical treatment for schwannomas is surgical excision; however, excision often results in high rates of neurological deficit. The authors retrospectively reviewed 20 patients who underwent excision of a schwannoma from 2007 to 2015. Twenty patients presented with a split fat sign and 12 patients presented with a Tinel's sign on magnetic resonance imaging. Only 3 patients presented with a target sign on magnetic resonance imaging. The operative approach involved removing the schwannoma, preserving the nearby nerve fascicles, and leaving the epineurium open. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 91 months (average, 29 months). At final follow-up, all patients were pain free. Nineteen patients had normal sensation and full function of their affected limb. One patient developed postoperative posterior interosseous nerve palsy. A Tinel's sign, preoperative pain, and a split fat sign on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging are the clinical symptoms most useful for diagnosing a schwannoma. Schwannomas can be safely removed via intracapsular surgical excision with minimal complications, yielding eradication of preoperative pain, normal sensation, and full function.

OBJECTIVES: To determine if one positioning technique provides superior visualization of critical landmarks (C7, T2, T12, L5-S1) and to determine any position dependent variations in regional measures or sagittal balance. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Different techniques for positioning patient's arms are used for 36" lateral radiograph with no data on relative effects. METHODS: A total of 25 scoliosis patients were prospectively studied with 36" lateral radiographs in three positions varying arm location (straight out, partially flexed, and the "clavicle" position). Films were analyzed independently by three surgeons. Vertebral landmarks were scored for clarity; and lordosis, kyphosis, and global balance were analyzed. Statistical analysis was done with a General Estimating Equations model. RESULTS: The overall visualization score for the clavicle position was superior to either the 60 degrees or 90 degrees positions (clavicle vs. 60 degrees, P {$<$} 0.0001; clavicle vs. 90 degrees, P {$<$} 0.0003). Analysis of vertebral landmarks showed significantly better visualization of T2 with clavicle versus 90 degrees (P {$<$} 0.047), better visualization of T12 with clavicle versus either 60 degrees (P {$<$} 0.006) or 90 degrees (P {$<$} 0.049), and better visualization of L5-S1 with clavicle versus 90 degrees (P {$<$} 0.02). Regional measures showed no differences, but sagittal balance was significantly more positive in the 60 degrees position than either clavicle (P {$<$} 0.04) or 90 degrees (P {$<$} 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: The clavicle position for obtaining lateral 36" radiographs produces significantly better overall visualization of critical vertebral landmarks. Regional measures do not differ between the three positions, but global balance is more positive with the 60 degrees position. Clinically, the clavicle position may result in more accurate radiographic measures and may minimize repeated radiograph exposures.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous inference is a common problem in many areas of application. If multiple null hypotheses are tested simultaneously, the probability of rejecting erroneously at least one of them increases beyond the pre-specified significance level. Simultaneous inference procedures have to be used which adjust for multiplicity and thus control the overall type I error rate. In this paper we describe simultaneous inference procedures in general parametric models, where the experimental questions are specified through a linear combination of elemental model parameters. The framework described here is quite general and extends the canonical theory of multiple comparison procedures in ANOVA models to linear regression problems, generalized linear models, linear mixed effects models, the Cox model, robust linear models, etc. Several examples using a variety of different statistical models illustrate the breadth of the results. For the analyses we use the R add-on package multcomp, which provides a convenient interface to the general approach adopted here.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Multilevel anterior decompressive procedures for cervical spondylotic myelopathy or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament may be associated with a high incidence of neurological morbidity, construct failure, and pseudoarthrosis. We theorized that laminectomy and stabilization of the cervical spine with lateral mass plates would obviate the disadvantages of anterior decompression, prevent the development of kyphotic deformity frequently seen after uninstrumented laminectomy, decompress the spinal cord, and produce neurological results equal or superior to those achieved by multilevel anterior procedures. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 38 patients who underwent laminectomy and lateral mass plating for cervical spondylotic myelopathy or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament between January 1994 and November 2001. Seventy-six percent of patients had spondylosis, 18\% had ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and 5\% had both. Clinical presentation included upper extremity sensory complaints (89\%), gait difficulty (70\%), and hand use deterioration (67\%). Spasticity was present in 83\%, and weakness of one or more muscle groups was seen in 79\%. Spinal cord signal abnormality on sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was seen in 68\%. Neurological evaluation was performed using a modification of the Japanese Orthopedic Association Scale for functional assessment of myelopathy, the Cooper Scale for separate evaluation of upper and lower extremity motor function, and a five-point scale for evaluation of strength in individual muscle groups. Lateral cervical spine x-rays were analyzed using a curvature index to determine maintenance of alignment. Each surgically decompressed level was graded on a four-point scale using axial MRI to assess the adequacy of decompression. Late follow-up was conducted by telephone interview. RESULTS: Laminectomy was performed at a mean 4.6 levels. Follow-up was obtained at a mean of 30.2 months after the procedure. The score on the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association scale improved in 97\% of patients from a mean of 12.9 preoperatively to 15.58 postoperatively (P {$<$} 0.0001). In the upper extremities, function measured by the Cooper Scale improved from 1.8 to 0.7 (P {$<$} 0.0001), and in the lower extremities, function improved from 1.0 to 0.4 (P {$<$} 0.0002). There was a statistically significant improvement in strength in the triceps (P {$<$} 0.0001), iliopsoas (P {$<$} 0.0002), and hand intrinsic muscles (P {$<$} 0.0001). X-rays obtained at a mean of 5.9 months after surgery revealed no change in spinal alignment as measured by the curvature index. There was a decrease in the mean preoperative compression grade from 2.46 preoperatively to 0.16 postoperatively (P {$<$} 0.0001). There was no correlation between neurological outcome and the presence of spinal cord signal change on T2-weighted MRI scans, patient age, duration of symptoms, or preoperative medical comorbidity. CONCLUSION: Multilevel laminectomy and instrumentation with lateral mass plates is associated with minimal morbidity, provides excellent decompression of the spinal cord (as visualized on MRI), produces immediate stability of the cervical spine, prevents kyphotic deformity, and precludes further development of spondylosis at fused levels. Neurological outcome is equal or superior to multilevel anterior procedures and prevents spinal deformity associated with laminoplasty or noninstrumented laminectomy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to characterize demographics, treatments, and outcomes in the management of unruptured cerebral aneurysms in the United States using a national healthcare database. METHODS: Clinical data were derived from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for the years 1997 through 2006. Patients with unruptured cerebral aneurysms were identified using the appropriate International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision code (437.3). Hospitalizations, length of stay, hospital charges, discharge pattern, age and gender distribution, and nature of intervention were analyzed. A Bureau of Labor statistics tool was used to adjust hospital and national charges for inflation. Population-adjusted rates were calculated using population estimates generated by the U.S. Census Bureau. RESULTS: Over 100 000 records were retrieved for analysis. During the time period studied, there was a 75\% increase in the number of hospitalizations associated with unruptured cerebral aneurysms. Inflation adjusted hospital charges increased by 60\%, whereas the total national bill increased by 200\%. Overall, length of stay decreased by 37\% and in-hospital mortality rates decreased by 54\%. The increasing number of hospitalizations and total national charges related to inpatient treatment of unruptured aneurysms were significantly associated with endovascular treatment rather than surgical clipping. CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent studies suggesting a low risk of rupture of incidentally diagnosed cerebral aneurysms, data from this study suggest an increasing trend of treatment for this entity in the United States. Furthermore, endovascular intervention is now the major driving force behind the increasing overall national charges. Given the current healthcare climate, the impact of these trends warrants discussion and debate.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Our understanding of spinal extradural arteriovenous fistulas (eAVFs) is relatively limited. In this study the authors aimed to provide the demographics, natural history, and treatment results of these rare lesions. METHODS: The authors performed a pooled analysis of data in the PubMed database through December 2012. Individualized patient data were extracted to elucidate demographic, clinical, and angioarchitectural features of spinal eAVFs as well as outcomes following different treatment strategies. RESULTS: Information on 101 patients was extracted from 63 eligible studies. The mean patient age was 45.9 years, and there was no significant overall sex predilection. Only 3\% of the lesions were incidental, whereas 10\% occurred in patients who had presented with hemorrhage. None of the 64 patients with at least 1 month of untreated follow-up sustained a hemorrhage over a total of 83.8 patient-years. Patients with lumbosacral eAVFs were significantly older (mean age 58.7 years, p {$<$} 0.0001), were significantly more often male (70\% male, p = 0.02), had significantly worse presenting Aminoff-Logue motor and bladder scores (p = 0.0008 and {$<$} 0.0001, respectively), and had the greatest prevalence of lesions with intradural venous drainage (62\% of cases, p {$<$} 0.0001). Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (30\% of cases, p {$<$} 0.0001) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (9\% of cases, p = 0.06) were associated with and exclusively found in patients with cervical eAVFs. The overall complete obliteration rate was 91\%. After a mean follow-up of 1.7 years, the clinical condition was improved in 89\% of patients, the same in 9\%, and worse in 2\%. Obliteration rates and outcome at follow-up did not significantly differ between surgical and endovascular treatment modalities. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal eAVFs are rare lesions with a low risk of hemorrhage; they cause neurological morbidity as a result of mass effect and/or venous hypertension. Their treatment is associated with a high rate of complete obliteration and improvement in preoperative symptoms.},

  abstract = {A fast numerical scheme is proposed to determine the velocity field of an incompressible fluid in a concentric annulus under a constant pressure gradient. The idea behind the scheme is to find the radius R in the annulus where the shear stress becomes zero. In the region from the inner wall at R={$\kappa$} to R, the shear rate is positive, while it is negative from this radius to the outer wall at r=1. Integrating the velocity field from the inner wall, where it is zero, one determines its value at R. This acts as the initial value for the integration of the shear rate over the second region, where the velocity must decrease to zero at the outer wall. Choosing a value for R, iterations continue to find its optimal value till the velocity on the outer wall vanishes to within an acceptable error term, which is 10-10 here. The numerical method chosen here delivers this result within 5 to 10 iterations for generalised Newtonian and PTT fluids. For viscoplastic fluids, instead of finding the optimal value for R which lies within the plug, one has to find its counterpart r1. Noting that the shear stress equals the yield stress at r1 and that the shear rate is positive from {$\kappa$} to r2 one finds the velocity at this radius. Since the width of the plug r2-r1 within the fluid is known and the velocity is constant across the plug, one integrates the velocity field from r2 to the outer wall at r=1 till the velocity approaches zero to within the chosen error term. Once again, the number of iterations to find the velocity field in Bingham and Herschel-Bulkley fluids is small and lies between 5 and 8. Finally, application of the numerical scheme to determine the velocity field in helical flows is also suggested.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective follow-up study was conducted in patients who underwent decompressive laminectomy for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. OBJECTIVES: To describe the long-term outcome of decompressive laminectomy performed for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, and to investigate preoperative factors that influenced outcomes, especially risk factors predisposing patients to poor results. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The success rate of surgical treatment of decompressive laminectomy for lumbar spinal stenosis varies. Long-term follow-up investigations have indicated deterioration of outcome; however, the causes of deterioration have not been fully investigated, and there have been no reports with a minimum 10-year follow-up. METHODS: Of 151 patients who underwent decompressive laminectomy from 1980 through 1989, 37 were followed up for a minimum of 10 years. The mean age at surgery was 60.9 +/- 8. 2 years (range, 43-76), and the average follow-up period was 13.1 +/- 2.1 years (range, 10.1-17.4). The results were evaluated by the criteria of the Japanese Orthopedic Association Lumbar Score, and the outcome was classified as excellent at more than 75\% improved score; good, 50-75\%; fair, 25-49\%; and poor, 0-24\% or less. Information about impairment of activities of daily living was also obtained at follow-up. Associations between preoperative clinical and radiographic variables and clinical outcome were evaluated statistically. RESULTS: In all patients, the average score improvement of 55.2 +/- 31.6\% was regarded as acceptable. The postoperative score and percentage of improvement of low back pain were lower than those of leg pain and walking ability. No impairment in activities of daily living was found in 62.2\% of the patients. Rate of improvement was evaluated as excellent in 13 (35.1\%), good in 8 (21.6\%), fair in 8, and poor in 8 patients. Three patients required additional surgery because of disc herniation at the laminectomied segments. The patients with multiple laminectomy (P = 0.034) and more than 10 degrees preoperative sagittal rotation angle (P = 0.018) showed a significantly poorer outcome than the remainder of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up showed that even without spinal fusion, more than half the patients were evaluated as excellent or good. Patients with more than a 10 degrees sagittalrotation angle who need multiple laminectomy, should be given information about the possibility of earlier deterioration of the outcome, and alternative or additional treatment such as concomitant spinal fusion with decompression may be considered.},

The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of enucleation and resection in terms of postoperative mortality and morbidity, freedom from vocal cord palsy, freedom from local recurrence, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and vocal handicap index (VHI). METHODS: Twentytwo consecutive patients were divided into two groups. Patients in group A (n~=~9) underwent intracapsular enucleation, whereas patients in Group B (n~=~13) underwent en bloc resection. Main endpoints of the study were postoperative mortality and morbidity, freedom from vocal cord palsy, freedom from local recurrence and quality of life. The quality of life after surgery was assessed according to the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) EQ-5D-5L methodology, and calculation of the voice handicap index (VHI). RESULTS: Postoperative mortality was nil. Morbidity included 1 wound dehiscence in group A and 2 transitory dysphagias in group B. Freedom from vocal cord palsy was 22\% in group A and zero in group B (p~=~0.15). Operation-specific local recurrence rate was 33\% (3/9 patients) in group A and nil in group B (0/23 patients) (p~=~0.05). QALYs was 0.55 in group A and 0.54 in group B (p~=~1.0). VHI was 23.77 in group A and 26.15 in group B (p~=~1.00). CONCLUSION: Resection is superior to enucleation in terms of freedom from local recurrence. Functional results are comparable for both techniques.},

QOL of middle-aged and elderly subjects was strongly related to sagittal balance and physical ability. INTRODUCTION: Spinal kyphosis with compression fracture and osteoporosis decrease QOL and increase mortality. However, it is unclear if kyphosis, spinal sagittal balance, muscle strength, and physical ability influence QOL. PURPOSE: The goal of the study was to evaluate the relationship of QOL with osteoporosis, spinal sagittal balance, spinal mobility, back muscle strength, and physical ability, including daily exercise, in middle-aged and elderly people. METHODS: The subjects were 304 persons (135 males and 169 females) who underwent a basic health checkup. Lumbar lateral radiograph findings, sagittal balance and spinal mobility determined with SpinalMouse\textregistered, grip, back muscle strength, and 10-m gait time were evaluated. RESULTS: SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) scores showed a significant negative correlation with age (r\,=\,-0.375), spinal inclination angle (r\,=\,-0.322), and 10-m gait time (r\,=\,-0.470), and a significant positive correlation with percent of the young adult mean of bone mineral density (r\,=\,0.223), lumbar lordosis angle (r\,=\,0.184), thoracic spinal range of motion (ROM; r\,=\,0.136), lumbar spinal ROM (r\,=\,0.130), grip strength (r\,=\,0.211), and back muscle strength (r\,=\,0.301).

In the exercise group, SF-36 PCS scores were significantly better (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) due to good spinal balance, thoracic spinal ROM, back muscle strength, and gait speed. CONCLUSIONS: QOL of middle-aged and elderly subjects was related to sagittal balance and physical ability.

The objective of this study was to investigate how factors such as spinal sagittal alignment, spinal range of motion, body balance, muscle strength, and gait speed influence falling in the prospective cohort study. METHODS: The subjects were 100 males who underwent a basic health checkup. Balance, SpinalMouse(\textregistered ) data, grip strength, back muscle strength, 10-m gait time, lumbar lateral standing radiographs, body mass index, and fall history over the previous year were examined. Platform measurements of balance included the distance of movement of the center of pressure (COP) per second (LNG/TIME), the envelopment area traced by movement of the COP (E AREA), and the LNG/E AREA ratio. The thoracic/lumbar angle ratio (T/L ratio) and sagittal vertical axis (SVA) were used as an index of sagittal balance. RESULTS: LNG/TIME and E AREA showed significant positive correlations with age, T/L ratio, SVA, and 10-m gait time; and significant negative correlations with lumbar lordosis angle, sacral inclination angle, grip strength and back muscle strength. Multiple regression analysis showed significant differences for LNG/TIME and E AREA with T/L ratio, SVA, lumbar lordosis angle and sacral inclination angle (R (2) = 0.399). Twelve subjects (12 \%) had experienced a fall over the past year. Age, T/L ratio, SVA, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral inclination angle, grip strength, back muscle strength, 10-m gait time, height of the intervertebral disc, osteophyte formation in radiographs and LNG/E AREA differed significantly between fallers and non-fallers. The group with SVA {$>$} 40 mm (n = 18) had a significant higher number of subjects with a single fall (6 single fallers/18: p = 0.0075) and with multiple falls (4 multiple fallers/18: p = 0.0095). CONCLUSION: Good spinal sagittal alignment, muscle strength and 10-m gait speed improve body balance and reduce the risk of fall. Muscle strength and physical ability are also important for spinal sagittal alignment. Body balance training, improvement of physical abilities including muscle training, and maintenance of spinal sagittal alignment can lead to prevention of fall.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A porcine model was used to study whether muscular activation in the paraspinal muscles caused by nerve stimulation in the anulus fibrosus of a lumbar intervertebral disc could be altered by saline injection into the zygapophysial (facet) joint. OBJECTIVES: To elucidate possible mechanisms regarding the nerve pathways and interactions between the intervertebral disc, zygapophysial joints, and the paraspinal musculature. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The physiologic basis for chronic low back pain, including muscular spasm, is uncertain. Although extensive research involving the lumbar motion segments and the surrounding tissues has been performed, the neuromuscular connection has not been sufficiently investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three adolescent pigs were used to measure the electromyographic response in the paraspinal musculature to electrical stimulation of the posterolateral L3-L4 anulus fibrosus, before and after introduction of physiologic saline into the zygapophysial joint. Motor unit action potentials were recorded using three sets of needle electrodes placed into the deepest fascicles of the multifidus, bilateral to the L4 and L5 spinous processes, and into the central longissimus musculature, bilateral to the L4 spinous process. RESULTS: Stimulation of the nerves within the posterolateral anulus of the disc elicited reactions in the paraspinal muscles, namely the lumbar multifidus and longissimus. Introduction of physiologic saline into the zygapophysial joint resulted in a reduction in the motor unit action potential amplitude. This reduction was manifested as an immediate and constant reduction, a graded reduction, or a delayed reaction, during which the reduction occurred an average of 5 minutes after the saline injection. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of physiologic saline into the zygapophysial joint reduced the stimulation pathway from the intervertebral disc to the paraspinal musculature. The zygapophysial joints may therefore have a regulating function, controlling the intricate neuromuscular balance in the lumbar motion segment.},

METHODS: A total of 2621 patients at 53 participating centers in the United States, Canada, and Europe were enrolled in the study, which had retrospective and prospective components. In the retrospective component, we assessed the natural history of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in 1449 patients with 1937 unruptured intracranial aneurysms; 727 of the patients had no history of subarachnoid hemorrhage from a different aneurysm (group 1), and 722 had a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage from a different aneurysm that had been repaired successfully (group 2). In the prospective component, we assessed treatment-related morbidity and mortality in 1172 patients with newly diagnosed unruptured intracranial aneurysms. RESULTS: In group 1, the cumulative rate of rupture of aneurysms that were less than 10 mm in diameter at diagnosis was less than 0.05 percent per year, and in group 2, the rate was approximately 11 times as high (0.5 percent per year). The rupture rate of aneurysms that were 10 mm or more in diameter was less than 1 percent per year in both groups, but in group 1, the rate was 6 percent the first year for giant aneurysms ({$>$} or =25 mm in diameter). The size and location of the aneurysm were independent predictors of rupture. The overall rate of surgery-related morbidity and mortality was 17.5 percent in group 1 and 13.6 percent in group 2 at 30 days and was 15.7 percent and 13.1 percent, respectively, at 1 year. Age independently predicted surgical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of rupture of unruptured intracranial aneurysms that were less than 10 mm in diameter was exceedingly low among patients in group 1 and was substantially higher among those in group 2. The risk of morbidity and mortality related to surgery greatly exceeded the 7.5-year risk of rupture among patients in group 1 with unruptured intracranial aneurysms smaller than 10 mm in diameter.},

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Geographic variations in the rates of lumbar spine surgery are significant within the United States. Although surgeon density correlates with the rates of spine surgery, other reasons for variation such as surgeon age and training background are poorly understood. METHODS: A total of 22 orthopedic surgeons and 8 neurosurgeons of varied ages and geographic regions answered questions regarding the need for surgery, surgical approach, and use of fusion and instrumentation for 5 simulated cases. Cases included: (1) multilevel stenosis without deformity or instability, (2) degenerative spondylolisthesis with stenosis, (3) isthmic (spondylolytic) spondylolisthesis with foraminal stenosis, (4) degenerative scoliosis with stenosis, and (5) recurrent stenosis following prior laminectomy without deformity or instability. The effects of surgeon age and training background on surgical decision making were analyzed using an independent samples t test and Fisher exact test, respectively. RESULTS: Significant variation in treatment approach among surgeons was noted for all cases except the patient with lytic spondylolisthesis, for whom all surgeons recommended fusion. Orthopedists recommended fusion and instrumentation more often than neurosurgeons for all cases, reaching significance for degenerative scoliosis with stenosis (P = 0.02 for both fusion and instrumentation). Younger surgeons were generally more likely to recommend instrumentation than their older peers, reaching significance for multilevel stenosis without deformity or instability and recurrent stenosis following prior laminectomy without deformity or instability (P = 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Variations in surgical approach to lumbar degenerative diseases may depend on a patient's clinical condition. This study found strong agreement in the approach to lytic spondylolisthesis but significant variation for other degenerative conditions of the lumbar spine. In addition, recommendation for fusion and instrumentation varied with surgeon age and training background. Previously documented geographic variations may result in part from a lack of consensus on appropriate treatment techniques for specific lumbar degenerative conditions, as well as surgeon-specific factors.},

The mean follow-up duration was 905.3 days. Aneurysm size was measured by 3-dimensional CT angiography. Clinical and 3-dimensional CT angiography follow-up were obtained every 6 months. RESULTS: Nineteen aneurysms ruptured during observation resulting in a 1.4\% rupture rate per year. A history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (hazard ratio, 7.3; 95\% CI, 2.5 to 21.2), posterior circulation aneurysm (hazard ratio, 2.9; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 8), and large size were significant independent predictors for aneurysm rupture.

OBJECTIVE: To report the usefulness of time-spatial labeling inversion pulse magnetic resonance imaging (T-SLIP MRI) for detection of the communicating hole(s) of spinal extradural arachnoid cysts (SEACs). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: SEACs normally communicate with the subarachnoid space via small communicating hole(s) in the dura. It is necessary to identify the accurate locations of these communicating hole(s) before attempting to close them through limited laminotomy/laminectomy. Myelocomputed tomography or conventional MRI may fail to detect the locations of the hole(s) because they comprise small dural defects. METHODS: Case 1: A 33-year-old female presented with an SEAC at the T11\textendash L2 vertebral level. Case 2: An 82-year-old female presented with an SEAC at T12\textendash L4 vertebral level. RESULTS: Case 1: T-SLIP MR image of the left parasagittal plane (not the midsagittal or right parasagittal plane) revealed cerebrospinal fluid flow from the subarachnoid space into the cyst at L1. After limited laminotomy at T12\textendash L1 and partial cyst resection, we identified 2 contiguous dural holes immediately medial to the left L1 pedicle; this corroborated the preoperative T-SLIP MRI findings. The holes were sutured. Postoperative conventional MR image confirmed significant cyst shrinkage. Case 2: T-SLIP MR image revealed a curved line at the L1 pedicle in the right parasagittal plane. After L1 laminectomy and partial cyst resection, a dural hole was identified L1 pedicle, which was in agreement with the preoperative T-SLIP MRI findings. After surgery, the lower extremity pain disappeared. Postoperative conventional MR image revealed significant cyst shrinkage. CONCLUSION: T-SLIP MRI is useful for detection of the communicating hole(s) of SEACs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.},

Between 1981 and 1988, a total of 35 patients underwent ALIF for isthmic spondylolisthesis. Of these, 23 patients were followed clinically and radiographically for more than 10 years (average, 13.3 years). The Japanese Orthopaedic Association low-back pain score was used to evaluate the outcome of subjective symptoms and clinical signs. The preoperative and postoperative percentage of slip, preoperative and postoperative intervertebral disk height, interbody graft union, and pars defect union were evaluated by serial radiographs. The adjacent disk degeneration was also evaluated by radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging. Although the low-back pain score worsened after 5 years, ALIF provides satisfactory overall long-term clinical results. The preoperative percentage of slip and the disk height were corrected after surgery, but at the time of interbody graft union, slip and disk height recurred as a result of grafted bone collapse. The rate of union in the grafted area was 83\%. In the nonunion cases, the scores gradually deteriorated with time, but the overall results were not different from those of union cases. Radiographs showed adjacent disk degeneration in 52\% of cases in the upper adjacent level and in 70\% of cases in the lower adjacent level, but these changes were not correlated with clinical outcomes.},

Some extensive surgical approaches for complete removal have been reported to lead to severe complications. Therefore, the surgical strategy for dumbbell-shaped neurinomas is controversial. METHODS: Twelve patients with dumbbell-shaped neurinomas were surgically treated in our hospital over 5 years. We adopted a posterior approach to remove the intracanalicular portion of the neurinomas as completely as possible, intentionally leaving the foraminal portion unresected to prevent bony and vascular insult. We investigated the postoperative surgical results and complications and the regrowth rate of the remnant lesions. RESULTS: Postoperative residual tumours were identified in 6 of the 12 patients. The perioperative neurological findings between the two groups were almost the same. The recurrence rate was low. Severe surgery-related complications occurred in only one patient with mild and temporary motor weakness. CONCLUSION: Our strategy demonstrated low rates of recurrence and complications compared with those accompanying the extensive alternative approaches that have been reported previously. Our case series showed that subtotal removal of dumbbell-shaped neurinomas using a posterior approach is a safer, more effective, and more minimally invasive treatment.},

  abstract = {The authors report on a new method for removing dumbbell-shaped spinal tumors that avoids the risk of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. Adequate visualization of the intra- and extradural components of the tumor is achieved with the use of separate dural incisions. First, the dura mater is opened along the dural theca to provide adequate visualization of the intradural portion of the mass; then, a second incision is made along the nerve root to remove the extradural component. Meticulous suturing is essential in intradural lesion cases; however, the dura mater is usually thin and fragile in such cases. During suturing with a needle and thread, the dura mater can become lacerated proximal to the needle holes and result in CSF leakage. In the authors' technique, instead of using a needle and thread, nonpenetrating vascular clips were used to close the dural incisions. When operating on dumbbell-shaped spinal tumors, the authors found that the "separate-dural-incision method" was preferable to the conventional T-shaped dural incision method because no dural defects occurred after the intradural procedure and meticulous dural closure with vascular clips was achieved. The authors conclude that the novel separate-dural-incision method for removing dumbbell-shaped tumors and the use of nonpenetrating vascular clips permits reliable dural closure, prevents postoperative CSF leakage, and promises good postoperative clinical results.},

However, reports describing this operative technique are few. To obtain a wide operative field and minimize thoracic spinal cord retraction, we employed a posterolateral transpedicular approach in ventral-located tumors and investigated the efficacy and limitations of this technique. METHOD: Eighteen patients with lesions (meningioma or neurinoma) located in the ventral intradural thoracic region were surgically treated between 2009 and 2014. The relationship among the clinical outcome, tumor location, and postoperative spinal alignment was analyzed. RESULTS: Postoperative neurological function improved in all patients, namely those with meningioma (p\,=\,0.012) and schwannoma (p\,=\,0.018). One patient who underwent removal of two facet joints suffered a postoperative compression fracture. Removal of two facet joints and pedicles resulted in a worsening of spinal alignment (p\,=\,0.03), while this was not the case for the removal of one facet joint and pedicle (p\,=\,0.72). CONCLUSIONS: This case series clarified the benefits of the posterolateral transpedicular approach for resection of ventral intradural extramedullary tumors. Removal of one pedicle and facet joint seems to be more beneficial.},

The search resulted in 684 references and eventually 29 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which eight were RCTs, four were prospective, and 17 were retrospective case series. Ten of the case series did not clearly identify consecutive patient selection. All the eight RCTs evaluated the effect of different techniques of posterolateral fusion (PLF). Evidence was found that the PLF was superior to non-operative treatment (exercise). Circumferential fusion was compared to PLF, but no difference could be found. PLF with or without instrumentation was evaluated in three studies, but no benefits from additional instrumentation were found. Other comparisons within PLF showed no effect of decompression, alternative instrumentation, or bone graft substitute. The 21 case series included 24 patient groups. PLF was used in 15 groups, good or excellent clinical outcome varied from 60 to 98\% and fusion rate varied from 81 to 100\%. Anterior interbody fusion was used in five groups, good or excellent clinical outcome varied from 85 to 94\% and fusion rate varied from 47 to 90\%. Posterior interbody fusion was used in two groups, good or excellent clinical outcome was 45\% and fusion rate was 80 and 95\%, respectively. Reduction, loss of reduction, and lordotic angles before and after the treatment was reported in only four studies. Average reduction achieved was 12.3\%, average loss of reduction at follow-up was 5.9\%. Preoperative lordotic angles were too heterogeneous to pool the results. Adjacent segment degeneration was not reported in any of the publications. A wide variety of complications were reported in 18 studies and included neurological complications, instrument failure, and infections. Fusion for low-grade isthmic spondylolisthesis has better outcomes than non-operative treatment. The current study could not identify the best surgical technique (PLF, PLIF, ALIF, instrumentation) to perform the fusion. However, instrumentation and/or decompression may play a beneficial role in the modern practice of reduction and fusion for low-grade isthmic spondylolisthesis, but there are no studies yet available to confirm this. The outcomes of fusion are generally good, but reports vary widely.},

The purpose of this study was to define the spectrum of presentation for spinal intramedullary CMs and the results of microsurgery for these benign but clinically progressive lesions. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed in 26 patients with histologically diagnosed CMs. All patients had undergone preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies. All patients were treated with a laminectomy and microsurgical resection of the malformation. CONCLUSIONS: The MR imaging findings are diagnostic for intramedullary CMs; these lesions abut a pial surface and have a characteristic imaging pattern. Spinal intramedullary CMs present with either an acute onset of neurological compromise or a slowly progressive neurological decline. Acute neurological decline occurs secondary to hemorrhage inside the spinal cord. Chronic progressive myelopathy occurs due to microhemorrhages and resulting gliotic reaction to blood products. Surgery and total removal of the lesion tends to halt progression of symptoms.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to assess the two surgical procedures of posterior fossa decompression (PDF) in treating Chiari malformation type I (CM-1) complicated by syringomyelia (SM), and to evaluate the postoperative complications, surgical effects and prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 115 adult CM-I patients undergoing surgical treatment from November 2013 to November 2016 in a single comprehensive hospital. These patients underwent the surgical procedure of either posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty (PFDD) or posterior fossa decompression combined with the resection of tonsils (PFDRT) by five experienced neurosurgeon in a single center. The clinical outcomes of these two surgical procedures were evaluated through comparing the clinical data before and 6 months after the operation. RESULTS: A total of 115 patients, including 35 men and 80 women with the mean age of 43.4\,{$\pm$}\,10.1 years (range, 16-60 years), were enrolled in the current study. 37 out of the 115 patients underwent PFDD, while the remaining 78 received PFDRT according to the surgical assessment. The operation time in PFDRT group (159.3\,{$\pm$}\,40.0\,min) was higher than that in PFDD group (134.1\,{$\pm$}\,30.8\,min) (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Besides, 20 cases in PFDRT group (20/78) developed postoperative dizziness and headache, and such incidence was higher than that in PFDD group (3/37) (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). After 6 months of follow-up, a total of 69 patients (88.4\%) in PFDRT group had alleviated symptoms, while 31 (83.8\%) patients in PFDD group had improved symptoms. Altogether, the SM cavity was reduced in 54 patients (69.2\%) in PFDRT group and 29 (78.4\%) in PFDD group, respectively, after the operation. No statistical differences in symptom improvement and cavity reduction rate could be witnessed between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that both PFDRT and PFDD can achieve comparable short-term clinical outcomes for adult CM-I patients. Surgical treatment is considered to be a reliable choice for the treatment of adult CM-I patients. Typically, PFDRT may lead to a higher risk of aseptic inflammatory complication. The precise surgical procedure should be selected based on detailed conditions of patients.},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate serial entire spine radiographs of healthy female volunteers and to clarify radiographical characteristics and predictors of pre-existing and de novo DLS. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: DLS is among the most frequent spinal defomities in the aging spine; however, the onset or the natural course of this condition has not been elucidated. METHODS: A total of 144 female volunteers were recruited from population register. Radiographical measurements using entire spine radiographs included thoracic kyphosis (T4-12), lumbar lordosis (LL) (L1-5), sacral inclination angle, pelvic incidence, sagittal balance (C7 plumb), coronal L4 endplate angle (L4 tilt), and scoliotic angle by Cobb method. More than 10\textdegree{} of scoliosis was diagnosed as DLS. L4 vertebral size was measured (divided by body height) as well as lateral osteophyte formation and lateral disc wedge angle. RESULTS: Mean baseline age and follow-up period were 54.4 years and 12.1 years, respectively. Pre-existing DLS (pre-DLS) was found in 42 subjects (29.2\%) at baseline. Among pre-DLS, 11 subjects (26\%) showed more than 5\textdegree{} progression in scoliosis. De novo DLS has developed in 30 subjects (29.4\%) among those without baseline scoliosis.Cox proportional hazards models revealed younger age, smaller L4 size, lower LL, greater DLS angle, and L4 tilt at baseline to be the risk factors of progression of pre-DLS and smaller L4 size, unilateral osteophyte formation, and lateral disc wedging to the risk of development of de novo DLS. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that younger age, smaller L4 size, lower LL, greater DLS angle, and L4 tilt at baseline should be evaluated as predictors of progression of pre-DLS. Early signs of asymmetric disc degeneration and smaller L4 size should also be evaluated as predictors of development of de novo DLS.},

Standard methods of investigation appropriate to the period were used, i.e. cerebral angiography, CT and MR scanning. Recently, some patients had specific venous studies including intraluminal cranial venous sinus pressure measurements. A sub-group (25 patients) was investigated for haematological abnormalities. The overall incidence of cranial venous outflow abnormality was 19.7\% (37 cases). In decades, related to the predominant investigative method, the figures were: to 1979, 4.2\% (2 cases); to 1989, 15.0\% (8 cases); to 1999, 31.0\% (27 cases). A cause of the venous abnormality was identified in 20 cases, most commonly haematological and iatrogenic. In 17 patients (all females) no cause was identified. Fifteen of the 25 patients (60\%) tested specifically were found to have a haematological abnormality, although no correlation was shown between this and a demonstrable venous outflow abnormality. The conclusion was drawn that there is a high incidence (close to one-third) of venous outflow abnormalities in PTS with detailed investigation. Issues of mechanism and therapy are discussed.},

Six patients had a symptomatic aneurysm, five had an incidentally discovered aneurysm, and 131 had multiple aneurysms, of which the ruptured lesion was clipped at the beginning of the follow-up study. The median follow-up time was 13.9 years (range 0.8 to 30.0 years). During 1944 patient-years of follow-up study there were 27 first episodes of hemorrhage from a previously unruptured aneurysm, giving an average annual rupture incidence of 1.4\%. Fourteen of these bleeding episodes were fatal. The cumulative rate of bleeding was 10\% at 10 years, 26\% at 20 years, and 32\% at 30 years after the diagnosis. The only predictor for the rupture was the size of the aneurysm (p = 0.036). However, in patients with multiple aneurysms (the main subgroup) the only variable that tended to predict rupture was the age of the patient: risk of rupture was inversely associated with age (p = 0.080). The median diameter of the aneurysms was 4 mm at the beginning of the follow-up period, both in those with and those without a later hemorrhage. During the angiographic monitoring period, a ruptured aneurysm significantly (p {$<$} 0.001) increased in size in 17 patients with hemorrhage but aneurysms did not increase significantly in 14 patients without hemorrhage. In addition, a new aneurysm was found in six of 31 patients. The authors conclude that an unruptured aneurysm should be operated on, irrespective of its size, if it is technically possible and the patient's age and concurrent diseases are not contraindications to surgery.},

We investigated the long-term natural history of unruptured intracranial aneurysms and risk factors predictive of subsequent rupture. METHODS: A total of 142 patients with 181 unruptured intracranial aneurysms diagnosed between 1956 and 1978, when these were not treated, were followed up until death or subarachnoid hemorrhage, or until 2011 to 2012. Annual and cumulative incidences of aneurysm rupture and risk factors for rupture were studied using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 21.0 (range, 0.8-52.3) years. During 3064 person-years, there were 34 first episodes of aneurysm rupture, giving an average annual incidence of 1.1\%. Eighteen patients died on account of an initial or recurrent aneurysm rupture. The cumulative rate of bleeding was 10.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 5.2-15.8) at 10 years, 23.0\% (95\% CI, 15.4-30.6) at 20 years, and 30.1\% (95\% CI, 21.3-38.9) at 30 years. None of the index aneurysms bled after a follow-up of 25 years. Cigarette smoking (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.44; 95\% CI, 1.02-5.88), location of the aneurysm in the anterior communicating artery (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.73; 95\% CI, 1.23-11.36), patient age inversely (0.96 per year, 95\% CI, 0.92-1.00) and aneurysm diameter {$\geq$}7 mm (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.60; 95\% CI, 1.13-5.98) independently predicted subsequent aneurysm rupture, as did alcohol consumption (1.27 per 100 g/week; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.53; P{$<$}0.05), but only in univariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking, patient age inversely, and the size and location of the unruptured intracranial aneurysm seem to be risk factors for aneurysm rupture. The risk of bleeding decreases with a very long-term follow-up.},

However, a retro-odontoid pseudotumor not associated with AAS, which undergoes spontaneous regression following C1 laminoplasty, has been reported. The purpose of this study was to report surgical outcomes of C1 laminectomy for retro-odontoid pseudotumor without AAS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cases of seven patients (mean age 75.6~{$\pm~$}7.6~years-old) with retro-odontoid pseudotumor without AAS were reviewed. The mean follow up time was 52.3~{$\pm~$}25.5~months. Each patient underwent a C1 laminectomy with an additional C3-6 expansion laminoplasty in three patients. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association score (JOA score) was used for neurological assessment. Pseudotumor size and additional AAS were analyzed using MRI and radiography. RESULTS: All patients exhibited neurological improvement following surgery, the JOA score improved from 7.2~{$\pm~$}3.2 to 14.1~{$\pm~$}2.6. The mean O-C2 and C2-7 angle decreased from -3.2~{$\pm~$}2.1\textdegree{} to -3.9~{$\pm~$}1.7\textdegree, showing a slight kyphotic change. Postoperative AAS was not observed. All pseudotumors spontaneously resolved, and recurrence and regrowth were not observed. Five patients had MRIs after gadolinium administration; four patients who showed enhancement of the pseudotumor had almost complete reduction within 1~year following surgery. DISCUSSION: Our study, assessing the outcome of C1 laminectomy for retro-odontoid pseudotumor, found neurological improvement in all cases. Since all pseudotumors were reduced and additional AAS was not observed, C1 laminectomy for retro-odontoid pseudotumor, in the absence of AAS, is recommended as a therapeutic strategy.},

  abstract = {Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC), or idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a syndrome associated with multiple clinical conditions. We hypothesize that most if not all etiologies result in an increase in intracranial venous pressure as a final common pathway. We studied 10 patients with PTC. Five had dural venous outflow obstruction as demonstrated by venography, and the five remaining patients had normal venous anatomy. Pressure measurements, made during venography in eight patients, all showed elevated pressures. Pressure measurements in the superior sagittal sinus ranged from 13 to 24 mm Hg (mean, 16.6 mm HG). Patients with obstruction tended to have a high pressure gradient across the stenotic segment. Five patients with normal dural venous anatomy had elevated right atrial pressures (range, 6 to 22 mm Hg; mean, 11.8 mm Hg), which were transmitted up to the intracranial venous sinuses. Endovascular techniques, including angioplasty and infusion of thrombolytic agents in some cases, improved outlet obstruction from a hemodynamic perspective but were ineffective in consistently and reliably alleviating the clinical manifestations of PTC. Patients in both groups tended to respond well to conventional CSF diversion procedures. Our study suggests that elevated intracranial venous pressure may be a universal mechanism in PTC of different etiologies. This elevated venous pressure leads to elevation in CSF and intracranial pressure by resisting CSF absorption. Although the mechanism leading to venous hypertension in the presence of outflow obstruction is obvious, the etiology of increased intracranial and central systemic venous pressure in PTC remains obscure.},

Cells lining the canal in the prenatal and newborn state and in the first decade of life were predominantly pseudostratified ciliated epithelium. In the second decade, the epithelium became simple columnar or cuboidal. The central canal closed in most cases after the age of 20 years, secondary to proliferation of ependymal cells and astrocytes. Mechanisms whereby the number of glial cells increase are considered. The canal was closed in all adults with normal ventricular size, and in 94\% of persons with various degrees of hydrocephalus. In the remaining 6\% of cases with hydrocephalus, the lining of the canal resembled that seen in the first two decades, and could have acted as a pathway of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption. Three cases of severe hydrocephalus in the first two decades of life were encountered; the central canal was patent in one, and occluded in two. Based on these data, the canal was not a significant pathway of CSF absorption in most instances of hydrocephalus and in persons with dilated ventricles who were older than 20 years of age.},

Recently, however, the standard endonasal approach has been expanded to provide access to other parasellar lesions. With the addition of the endoscope, this expansion has significant potential for the resection of skull base lesions. METHODS: The anatomical landmarks and surgical techniques used in expanded (extended) endoscopic approaches to the clivus and cervicomedullary junction are reviewed and presented, accompanied by case illustrations of each segment (or module) of approach. The caudal portion of the midline anterior skull base and the cervicomedullary junction is divided into modules of approach: the middle third of the clivus, its lower third, and the cervicomedullary junction. Case illustrations of successful resections of lesions via each module of the approach are presented and discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic expanded endonasal approaches to caudally located midline anterior skull base and cervicomedullary lesions are feasible and hold great potential for decreased morbidity. The effectiveness and appropriate use of these techniques must be evaluated by close examination of outcomes as case series expand.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine the 7- to 10-year outcome of surgery for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is limited information on the impact of surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis on symptoms, walking ability, and satisfaction, as well as reoperation. METHODS: Patients completed standardized questionnaires in 1993 that included items about reoperations, back pain, leg pain, walking capacity, and satisfaction with surgery. Associations between preoperative demographic and clinical variables and outcomes 7 to 10 years after surgery were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Average preoperative age was 69 years and eight patients received fusion. Of 88 patients in the original cohort, 20 (23\%) were deceased and 20 (23\%) had undergone reoperation by 7- to 10-year follow-up. Fifty-five patients answered questionnaires. Average duration of follow-up was 8.1 years. Thirty-three percent of the respondents had severe back pain at follow-up, 53\% were unable to walk two blocks, and 75\% were satisfied with the results of surgery. The severity of current spine-related symptoms was a stronger correlate of physical functional status at the time of follow-up than age or nonspinal comorbid conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Seven to 10 years after decompressive surgery for spinal stenosis, 23\% of patients had undergone reoperation and 33\% of respondents had severe back pain. Despite a high prevalence of nonspinal problems in this elderly cohort, spinal symptoms were the most important correlate of reduced functional status.},

  abstract = {DESIGN: A prospective, multicenter observational study. OBJECTIVES: 1) Identify correlates of the decision to perform arthrodesis in patients undergoing laminectomy for lumbar spinal stenosis. 2) Compare symptoms, walking capacity, and satisfaction 6 and 24 months after laminectomy alone and laminectomy with noninstrumented and with instrumented arthrodesis. BACKGROUND DATA: Few prospective studies have compared outcomes of laminectomy alone or laminectomy with noninstrumented or with instrumented arthrodesis in patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. There is uncertainty regarding the optimal use of arthrodesis and instrumentation. METHODS: Two hundred seventy--two patients undergoing--surgery for degenerative lumbar stenosis by eight surgeons at four centers were included in the study cohort. Of these, 37 had noninstrumented and 41 had instrumented arthrodesis. Logistic regression identified factors associated with arthrodesis. The principal outcomes-health status, walking capacity, back and leg pain, and satisfaction with surgery-were assessed 6 and 24 months postoperatively with univariate and multivariate techniques. Outcomes also were assessed in a restricted cohort of patients with at least 5 mm spondylolisthesis and/or 15 degrees scoliosis. Hospital costs were obtained from a computerized hospital cost accounting system. RESULTS: The major predictor of the decision to perform arthrodesis was the individual surgeon (P = 0.0001). Noninstrumented arthrodesis was associated with superior relief of low back pain at 6 months (P = 0.004) and 24 months (P = 0.01). This difference persisted in multivariate analyses, with borderline statistical significance. There were no significant differences in the other outcomes across treatment groups. Mean hospital costs of laminectomy alone and noninstrumented and instrumented arthrodesis were \$12,615, \$18,495, and \$25,914, respectively (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Findings were limited by the small number of participating surgeons, modest sample size that produced P values of borderline significance, and nonrandomized design. With these caveats in mind, the authors conclude: (1) The individual surgeon was a more important correlate of the decision to perform arthrodesis than clinical variables such as spondylolisthesis. (2) Noninstrumented arthrodesis resulted in superior relief of back pain after 6 and 24 months. (3) Instrumented arthrodesis was the most costly option. These results highlight the need for randomized controlled trials and cost effectiveness analyses of lumbar arthrodesis and instrumentation in patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis.},

PURPOSE: To present the surgical outcomes of single-sided keyhole laminotomies aimed to excise large ventral IDEM spinal cord menengiomas. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Less invasive procedures, such as laminotomies and osteoplastic laminotomies, have been previously described in the literature, but an approach that interferes with spinal stability to an even lesser extent would be more desirable. METHODS: Tumors were removed through a slit-like space between the dura and spinal cord without retraction of the spinal cord. The neurological conditions of patients were evaluated pre- and postoperatively with the Nurick grading system. Pathologic subtypes, preoperative symptom duration, tumor location on the sagittal and axial planes, and the percentage of tumor occupying the intradural space were investigated. On follow-up, magnetic resonance imaging was conducted to evaluate whether the tumor had recurred. RESULTS: All tumors were localized either ventrally or ventrolaterally. Of the spinal menengiomas, four were cervical and four were thoracic. All lesions were completely excised, and the neurological condition improved in six patients. The remaining two patients already had preoperative Nurick grades of 0, and this score was maintained postoperatively. Neither kyphotic changes nor instability developed in any patient during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Total resection of anterior and anterolateral IDEM menengiomas, without introducing new neurological deficits, can be performed by an isolated posterior approach through a single-sided keyhole laminotomy. However, this approach should be applied cautiously and with a thorough understanding of its limitations.},

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of minimally invasive (MIS) decompression for focal lumbar spinal stenosis (FLSS) in patients with and without deformity. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: MIS, facet-preserving decompression has the potential of offering a significantly less morbid alternative to decompression and fusion in patients with leg dominant symptoms from degenerative spondylolisthesis and/or scoliosis. METHODS: Single surgeon, consecutive series (n=75), evaluated over 5 years. All patients had MIS lumbar laminoplasty (bilateral decompression from a unilateral approach) for FLSS (1-2 level). Patients had leg dominant, claudicant/radicular pain. Patients were divided into 4 groups: (A) stenosis with no deformity, n=22; (B) stenosis with spondylolisthesis only, n=25; (C) stenosis with scoliosis, n=16; and (D) stenosis combined with spondylolisthesis and scoliosis, n=12. The primary clinical outcome measures were the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and surgical revision rate. Preoperative and postoperative standing radiographs were assessed. RESULTS: The average age was 68 years (40-89) with a mean time from surgery of 36.5 months (18-68). Average clinical improvement in ODI was 49.5\% to 23.9\% [mean postoperative follow-up of 31.8 months (24-72): group A=mean of 34.6; B=28.9; C=32.7; D=30 months]. Incidence of preoperative grade I spondylolisthesis was 46\%. Spondylolisthesis progression (mean=8.4\%) occurred in 9 patients and 2 patients developed spondylolisthesis. Overall revision rate was 10\% [repeat decompression alone (n=2) and decompression and fusion (n=6)]. Subgroup analysis of preoperative and postoperative ODI and revision rate revealed (A) 48\% to 18.7\%, 0\%; (B) 48\% to 24.6\%, 4\%; (C) 50.7\% to 31.5\%; 25\%; and (D) 53\% to 22\%, 25\%, respectively. The revision rate for patient with scoliosis (C+D) was significant (P=0.0035) compared with those without. Six of the 8 revised patients had a preoperative lateral (rotatory) listhesis (3 in C and 3 in D). CONCLUSION: MIS decompression alone for leg dominant symptoms is a clinically effective procedure in the majority of patients including those with degenerative spondylolisthesis or scoliosis.

  abstract = {Background: Cubital tunnel syndrome is the second most common entrapment neuropathy of the upper extremity in the United States. Most cases are idiopathic and symptoms consist of a combination of weakness, pain, and sensory disturbances ranging from paresthesias and dysesthesias to numbness or complete anesthesia. The purpose of this study is to report results of a novel, minimally invasive surgical procedure for cubital tunnel syndrome with comparison to existing interventions including full open or endoscopic approaches. Methods: A total of 41 consecutive patients underwent the procedure, their ages ranged from ages 36 to 81 with an average age of 60.52{$\pm$}12.18 years. The procedure consists of a 1.0-2.0-cm incision with decompression of the ulnar nerve under direct visualization proximally with Metzenbaum scissors as a dilator for distal decompression. Patients were evaluated for improvements in pain, numbness, paresthesias, weakness, and muscle atrophy and was measured utilizing the Gabel/Amadio scale. Results: Fifty-three point two percent (n=25) of patients were found to have excellent outcomes, 36.2\% (n=17) had good outcomes, 8.5\% (n=4) had fair outcomes, and 2.1\% (n=1) had poor outcomes as determined by the Gabel/Amadio scale. The greatest improvement in all patients was the reduction in sensory symptoms: pain, numbness, and paresthesia. There were no operative or postoperative complications. Conclusions: This novel procedure provided symptom relief comparable to the most effective existing techniques without significant complications, and with rapid recovery and minimal scar formation. The authors assert that this technique demonstrates optimal results for patients with relative ease of adoption for surgeons.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: Determine proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) prevalence and analyze risk factors associated with PJK in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients following 3 different posterior segmental spinal instrumentation and fusion surgeries. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: No comparison study exists on proximal junctional AIS changes following 3 different segmental posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion surgeries at 2 years postoperative. METHODS: A clinical/radiographic assessment was conducted in 410 consecutive AIS patients (average age = 14.7, range = 10.6-20) (men/women = 73/337) treated with instrumented segmental posterior spinal fusion with 2-year follow-up. Revision and anterior cases were not included. Standing long-cassette radiographic measurements were analyzed including various sagittal/coronal parameters for preoperative, early postoperative, and 2-year follow-up. Abnormal PJK was defined by proximal junction sagittal Cobb angles between the lower endplate of the uppermost instrumented vertebra and the upper endplate of 2 supradjacent vertebrae {$>$}or=+10 degrees and at least 10 degrees greater than the preoperative measurement at 2 years postoperative. RESULTS: PJK prevalence defined at 2 years postoperative was 27\% (111 of 410 patients). Statistically significant factors: larger preoperative thoracic kyphosis angle (T5-T12 {$>$}40 degrees vs. T5-T12 10 degrees -40 degrees vs. T5-T12 {$<$}10 degrees ; P {$<$} 0.0001), greater immediate postoperative thoracic kyphosis angle decrease (decrease {$>$}5 degrees vs. 5 degrees decrease-5 degrees increase vs. increase {$>$}5 degrees ; P {$<$} 0.0001), thoracoplasty versus no thoracoplasty (P = 0.001), and men versus women (P = 0.007). Instrumentation types (hook-only vs. proximal hook, distal pedicle screw vs. pedicle screw P = 0.058), number of fused vertebrae {$>$}12 versus 12{$>$}or= (P = 0.12), the uppermost instrumented vertebra among T2, T3, T4, T5 (P = 0.75). There were no significant differences in Scoliosis Research Society Patient Questionnaire-24 outcome-scores (PJK total score = 97.0, self-image subscales = 21.3 vs. non-PJK group = 95.3, 21.0) (P = 0.34 total score, P = 0.54 self-image subscale). CONCLUSION: Two-year postoperative PJK prevalence in AIS following 3 different posterior segmental spinal instrumentation and fusion surgeries was 27\%. A larger preoperative thoracic kyphosis angle, greater immediate postoperative thoracic kyphosis angle decrease, thoracoplasty, and male sex correlated significantly with PJK. There were no significant differences in Scoliosis Research Society Patient Questionnaire-24 outcome-scores between the PJK and non-PJK group.},

As a result of improvements in the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging modality, it plays not only a fundamental role in the detection of space-occupying lesions, but also a compensatory role in clinically and electrodiagnostically inconclusive cases. Although ultrasound has undergone further development in the past decades and shows high resolution capabilities, it has inherent limitations due to its operator dependency. We review the course of normal peripheral nerves, as well as various clinical demonstrations and pathological features of compressed and entrapped nerves in the upper extremities on MR imaging, according to the nerves involved. The common sites of nerve entrapment of the upper extremity are as follows: the brachial plexus of the thoracic outlet; axillary nerve of the quadrilateral space; radial nerve of the radial tunnel; ulnar nerve of the cubital tunnel and Guyon's canal; median nerve of the pronator syndrome, anterior interosseous nerve syndrome, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Although MR imaging can depict the peripheral nerves in the extremities effectively, radiologists should be familiar with nerve pathways, common sites of nerve compression, and common space-occupying lesions resulting in nerve compression in MR imaging.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dumbbell tumor is considered a distinct group of tumors of the spinal nerve sheath owing to its intriguing clinical and radiological characteristics. More than half of dumbbell tumors are completely restricted to the extradural space, although preoperative MRI in some cases suggests the presence of intradural/extradural tumors. The aim of this retrospective investigation is to elucidate the clinical features and to suggest the surgical strategy to reduce the operating time and prevent additional complications in extradural type. METHODS: The medical records and radiological studies of 7 consecutive cases (4 male, 3 female, mean age 40.4 years) who underwent removal of the intraspinal component of their extradural dumbbell tumors between January 1996 and December 2005 were analyzed. Diagnosis and preoperative evaluation were performed with MRI and myelogram/CTs. RESULTS: The relationship of the tumor mass to dural sac in preoperative MRIs was so indistinct as to suggest an intradural mass in 5 cases. We found that extradural portion was covered with an attenuated dura and that the dural ring was invaginated into the intradural portion in these cases. Therefore, the author began with the epidural removal of the intraspinal and extraspinal component, followed by carefully extracting the intradural-like mass. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we suggest that invagination of the dural ring is the anatomical feature that may be confused with an intradural/extradural tumor during operations for extradural dumbbell tumors. Initial epidural mass removal, extraction of intradural/extradural tumors subsequent to dural opening, and affirmation of presence of intradural tumor remnant could save time during dumbbell tumor surgery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The most common surgical treatment of symptomatic degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (DLS) is decompression and instrumented fusion. However, contemporary, midline-sparing, microdecompressive techniques have shown good results for selected patients with stable Grade 1 DLS. Growing concerns over the rising cost and rates of spinal fusion warrant both clinical and economic comparative effectiveness research in this common spinal diagnosis. PURPOSE: To determine the relative cost-utility of decompression with and without concomitant instrumented fusion for selected patients with DLS. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Comparative cost-effectiveness study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Probabilities and utilities were estimated from an observational cohort study and the current literature. Costing information was obtained from our institution (microcase costing data/patient) and the literature. Probabilities considered were perioperative and general mortality, probability of clinical improvement and clinical worsening, and reoperation. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incremental cost/utility ratio (ICUR) expressed as the differential cost per relative gain in quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). METHODS: A Markov model with 10-year follow-up was developed. The analyses were carried out from the hospital's perspective. Sensitivity analysis was used to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: The cost-utility of decompression with fusion and decompression alone at 10 years postintervention was \$3,281/QALY and \$1,040/QALY, respectively. Compared with decompression alone, decompression plus instrumented fusion was associated with an improvement in quality of life at a cost of \$185,878 per QALY in the base-case analysis. The ICUR was invariant to changes in clinical effectiveness of decompression alone, percentage of inpatient decompressions, and varying cost or QALY discounting rates. The ICUR was sensitive to change in QALY and cost structure changes. CONCLUSIONS: For a select subgroup of patients with DLS (leg-dominant pain with a stable Grade 1 spondylolisthesis), decompression without fusion is significantly more cost effective than instrumented fusion and provides an opportunity for increased service delivery and/or cost savings for this growing population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Lumbar spinal stenosis is one of the most common degenerative spine diseases. Surgical options are largely divided into decompression only and decompression with arthrodesis. Recent randomized trials showed that surgery was more effective than nonoperative treatment for carefully selected patients with lumbar stenosis. However, some patients require reoperation because of complications, failure of bony fusion, persistent pain, or progressive degenerative changes, such as adjacent segment disease. In a previous population-based study, the 10-year reoperation rate was 17\%, and fusion surgery was performed in 10\% of patients. Recently, the lumbar fusion surgery rate has doubled, and a substantial portion of the reoperations are associated with a fusion procedure. With the change in surgical trends, the longitudinal surgical outcomes of these trends need to be reevaluated. PURPOSE: To provide the longitudinal reoperation rate after surgery for spinal stenosis and to compare the reoperation rates between decompression and fusion surgeries. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective cohort study using national health insurance data. PATIENT SAMPLE: A cohort of patients who underwent initial surgery for lumbar stenosis without spondylolisthesis in~2003. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was any type of second lumbar surgery. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to compare the adjusted reoperation rates between decompression and fusion surgeries. METHODS: A national health insurance database was used to identify a cohort of patients who underwent an initial surgery for lumbar stenosis without spondylolisthesis in 2003; a total of 11,027 patients were selected. Individual patients were followed for at least 5 years through their encrypted unique resident registration number. After adjusting for confounding factors, the reoperation rates for decompression and fusion surgery were compared. RESULTS: Fusion surgery was performed in 20\% of patients. The cumulative reoperation rate was 4.7\% at 3 months, 7.2\% at 1 year, 9.4\% at 2 years, 11.2\% at 3 years, 12.5\% at 4 years, and 14.2\% at 5 years. The adjusted reoperation rate was not different between decompression and fusion surgeries (p=.82). The calculated reoperation rate was expected to be 22.9\% at 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: The reoperation rate was not different between decompression and fusion surgeries. With current surgical trends, the reoperation rate appeared to be higher than in the past, and consideration of this problem is required.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because training of the lumbar muscles is a commonly recommended intervention in low back pain (LBP), it is important to clarify whether lumbar muscle atrophy is related to LBP. Fat infiltration seems to be a late stage of muscular degeneration, and can be measured in a non-invasive manner using magnetic resonance imaging. The purpose of this study was to investigate if fat infiltration in the lumbar multifidus muscles (LMM) is associated with LBP in adults and adolescents. METHODS: In total, 412 adults (40-year-olds) and 442 adolescents (13-year-olds) from the general Danish population participated in this cross-sectional cohort study. People with LBP were identified through questionnaires. Using MRI, fat infiltration of the LMM was visually graded as none, slight or severe. Odds ratios were calculated for both age groups, taking into account sex, body composition and leisure time physical activity for both groups, and physical workload (in adults only) or daily bicycling (in adolescents only). RESULTS: Fat infiltration was noted in 81\% of the adults but only 14\% of the adolescents. In the adults, severe fat infiltration was strongly associated with ever having had LBP (OR 9.2; 95\% CI 2.0-43.2), and with having LBP in the past year (OR 4.1; 1.5-11.2), but there was no such association in adolescents. None of the investigated moderating factors had an obvious effect on the OR in the adults. CONCLUSION: Fat infiltration in the LMM is strongly associated with LBP in adults only. However, it will be necessary to quantify these measurements objectively and to investigate the direction of this link longitudinally in order to determine if the abnormal muscle is the cause of LBP or vice versa.},

For each a score between 0 and 5 is given. The grading is designed in such a way that levels of functional significance receive separate scores: 0 = no function, 1 = severely disabled, 2 = disabled, 3 = severely compromised but function preserved, 4 = slightly compromised, and 5 = normal function. In general, scores between 0 and 2 indicate insufficient functional capacity and an unsatisfactory condition. Scores between 3 and 5 represent levels of function which should be the aim of treatment.

Twenty-nine patients have not been surgically treated to date because of their stable neurological status. Seventy-eight patients with progressive neurological deficits underwent a total of 121 surgical procedures and were followed for a mean period of 32 (+/- 37) months. All patients demonstrated arachnoid scarring at a level close to the syrinx. In 52 patients the arachnoid scarring was related to spinal trauma, whereas 55 had no history of trauma and developed arachnoid scarring was a result of an inflammatory reaction. Of these, 15 patients had undergone intradural surgery, eight had suffered from spinal meningitis, three had undergone peridural anesthesia, and one each presented with a history of osteomyelitis, spondylodiscitis, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. No obvious cause for the inflammatory reaction resulting in arachnoid scarring could be ascertained for the remaining 26 patients. The postoperative neurological outcome correlated with the severity of arachnoid pathology and the type of surgery performed. Shunting of the syrinx to the subarachnoid, pleural, or peritoneal cavity was associated with recurrence rates of 92\% and 100\% for focal and extensive scarring, respectively. Successful long-term management of the syrinx required microsurgical dissection of the arachnoid scar and decompression of the subarachnoid space with a fascia lata graft. This operation stabilized the preoperative progressive neurological course in 83\% of patients with a focal arachnoid scar. For patients with extensive arachnoid scarring over multiple spinal levels or after previous surgery, clinical stabilization was achieved in only 17\% with this technique.},

METHODS: Case records, operation notes, outpatient files, and radiological examinations were analyzed for all patients treated between September 1977 and August 1994. Additional follow-up data were obtained using outpatient examinations, questionnaires, and telephone calls. RESULTS: During the study period, 128 spinal neuromas (i.e., schwannomas) and 6 neurofibromas in 87 patients were treated. Fifty-seven neuromas were associated with NF-2 in 17 patients and six neurofibromas with NF-1 in 3 patients. Patients with NF-2 and symptomatic neuromas presented with more severe neurological deficits compared to patients without NF-2. Eighty-six percent of the neuromas were removed completely. On average, most preoperative deficits or symptoms improved in patients without NF-2, whereas neurological symptoms remained unchanged in patients with NF-2. Multiple regression analysis revealed that partial removal, surgery of a recurrent tumor, NF-2, and old age predisposed for tumor recurrence. No increased risk of recurrence was observed for patients with NF-1. For patients without NF-2, we observed overall recurrence rates of 10.7\% after 5 years and 28.2\% after 10 and 15 years, respectively, as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. For NF-2, the recurrence rate at 5 years was 39.2\%, and all tumors had recurred by 9 years. CONCLUSION: Spinal nerve sheath tumors carry an excellent prognosis in patients with NF-1 and in patients without neurofibromatosis. Symptomatic neuromas occurring in association with NF-2 present with more severe neurological deficits, demonstrate little postoperative improvement, and have a very high recurrence rate.},

None of them offers a sufficient basis to serve as a concept for the treatment of all affected patients. Apart from a discussion of the different hypotheses this paper proposes a new pathophysiological concept based on clinical, experimental and literature studies. Syringomyelia is understood as a state of chronic interstitial edema of the spinal cord due to accumulation of extracellular fluid (ECF). This accumulation is caused by a cascade of events starting with obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow and/or spinal cord tethering which ultimately alter ECF flow and increase ECF volume. Treatment should be targeted against the pathological process which causes CSF flow obstruction and cord tethering to inhibit this pathophysiological process at a decisive point.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Syringomyelia is considered as a fluid-filled cavitation inside the spinal cord. However, there is no agreement whether a dilated central canal should be included under this heading or how glioependymal cysts, myelomalacias, or cystic tumors should be distinguished from syringomyelia. This article provides a definition of syringomyelia and guidelines for its diagnosis. METHODS: Between 1991 and 2015, of 3206 patients with spinal cord pathologies 2276 demonstrated cystic features. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Syringomyelia was differentiated from cystic intramedullary tumors, glioependymal cysts, myelomalacias, and dilatations of the central canal by clinical and radiologic criteria. RESULTS: A total of 1535 patients were diagnosed with syringomyelia, 635 with dilatations of the central canal, 52 with glioependymal cysts, 52 with mylomalacias, and 2 with cystic intramedullary spinal cord tumors. Additional neuroradiologic studies revealed the causes of syringomyelia. As a result 604 patients showed pathologies at the craniocervical junction leading to disturbances of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. The commonest was a Chiari I malformation in 543 patients. Nine hundred thirty-one patients presented with pathologies in the spinal canal. The commonest causes were spinal arachnopathies, leading to CSF flow obstructions in 533 patients, intramedullary tumors in 152 patients, and tethered cord syndromes in 69 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of syringomyelia should be reserved for patients with a fluid-filled cavity in the spinal cord related to either a disturbance of CSF flow, spinal cord tethering, or an intramedullary tumor. For patients in whom such a relation cannot be established, the diagnosis of syringomyelia should be withheld.},

OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of endoscopic foraminal decompression and mobilization of the exiting and transiting nerves, discectomy, ablation of osteophytes, and impinging pars as a means of treatment by the posterolateral approach. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Open decompression with or without fusion is a commonly accepted procedure for symptomatic isthmic spondylolytic spondylolisthesis in patients who fail to respond to conservative treatment. There is no published data on the outcome of endoscopic procedures for this condition. METHODS: Endoscopic foraminal decompression achieved with laser-assisted bone and soft-tissue ablation was performed on 12 males and 12 females with an average age of 42.4 years (36-72 years) followed for an average period of 34 months (28-46 months). The average preoperative duration of symptoms was 6.1 years (3-9 years). RESULTS: One hundred percent cohort integrity was maintained at the final follow-up. Results were analyzed using the percentage change in Oswestry Disability Scores and in Visual Analogue Pain scores. Using a percentage change in Oswestry Disability Score of 50 or more plus VAP scores of 50 or more to determine good and excellent outcomes, 79\% (19 out of 24) exceeded this value. CONCLUSION: Laser-assisted endoscopic foraminal decompression provides a minimalist means of exploring the extraforaminal zone, the isthmic defect, the foramen and its contents, the disc and the epidural space. It allows adequate resection with decompression and discectomy, without the need for open decompression and fusion, and targets the symptomatic level effectively in patients with Grade I-III isthmic spondylolisthesis.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Retro-odontoid pseudotumor is common in elderly people and is a cause of cervical myelopathy. The goal of the study was to investigate surgical procedures, outcomes, and post-operative spontaneous regression of posterior cervical retro-odontoid pseudotumors. METHODS: The subjects were 29 patients who underwent surgery for myelopathy due to a retro-odontoid pseudotumor around the craniocervical region at 9 facilities and were followed-up for an average of 54~months (range 12-96~months). Data were collected in a multicenter review of a retrospective database. Comparisons were performed between cases treated with and without fusion. RESULTS: The JOA recovery rate at final follow-up did not differ significantly between the fusion (n\,=\,17, including all 15 patients with atlantoaxial subluxation) and non-fusion (n\,=\,12) groups. However, pseudotumor regression was significantly more frequent in the fusion group (100\% vs. 42\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.01). In all patients, regression cases had significantly higher rates of contrast enhancement of the pseudotumor on pre-operative T1 gadolinium-enhanced MRI (68\% vs. 14\%, p\,=\,0.013) and of JOA recovery (50\% vs. 30\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Regression of pseudotumor occurred in all cases treated with fusion surgery. There was a significant difference in pseudotumor regression with or without fusion, and regression was significantly related to gadolinium enhancement on MRI. Therefore, it is preferable to use fusion surgery for a retro-odontoid pseudotumor that shows contrast enhancement, even if there is no apparent instability pre-operatively.

  abstract = {The management of unruptured cerebral aneurysms remains one of the most controversial topics in neurosurgery. To this end, we discuss the diagnosis and estimated prevalence of these lesions as well as review the literature regarding the rate of rupture for cerebral aneurysms and risks of operative intervention. Our interpretation of the literature concludes that aneurysms are present in approximately 1\% of the adult population, varying between less than 1\% in young adults to 4\% in the elderly. The yearly risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage for an unruptured intracranial aneurysm is approximately 1\% for lesions 7 to 10 mm in diameter. Based on these assumptions, we recommend that 1) with rare exceptions, all symptomatic unruptured aneurysms should be treated; 2) small, incidental aneurysms less than 5 mm in diameter should be managed conservatively in virtually all cases; 3) aneurysms larger than 5 mm in patients younger than 60 years of age should be seriously considered for treatment; 4) large, incidental aneurysms larger than 10 mm should be treated in nearly all patients younger than 70 years of age; and 5) microsurgical clipping rather than endovascular coiling should be the first treatment choice in low-risk cases. Critical to our guidelines is collaboration by a highly experienced cerebrovascular team of microneurosurgeons and endovascular neurosurgeons working at a tertiary medical center with a high case volume and using a decision-making paradigm designed to offer only low-risk treatments. In certain patients for whom both treatment and natural history carry high risks, such as those with giant aneurysms, nonoperative management is typically elected.},

  abstract = {The exact pathogenesis of syringomyelia associated with Chiari type 1 malformation is unknown, although a number of authors have reported their theories of syrinx formation. The purpose of this review is to understand evidences based on the known theories and to create a new hypothesis of the pathogenesis. We critically review the literatures on clinicopathological, radiological, and clinical features of this disorder. The previously proposed theories mainly focused on the driven mechanisms of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the spinal cord. They did not fully explain radiological features or effects of surgical treatment such as shunting procedures. Common findings of the syrinx in clinicopathological studies were the communication with the central canal and extracanalicular extension to the posterior gray matter. Most of the magnetic resonance imaging studies demonstrated blockade and alternated CSF dynamics at the foramen magnum, but failed to show direct communication of the syrinx with the CSF spaces. Pressure studies revealed almost identical intrasyrinx pressure to the subarachnoid space and decreased compliance of the spinal CSF space. Recent imaging studies suggest that the extracellular fluid accumulation may play an important role. The review of evidences promotes a new hypothesis of syrinx formation. Decreased absorption mechanisms of the extracellular fluid may underlie the pathogenesis of syringomyelia. Reduced compliance of the posterior spinal veins associated with the decreased compliance of the spinal subarachnoid space will result in disturbed absorption of the extracellular fluid through the intramedullary venous channels and formation of syringomyelia.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe the anatomic and imaging features of CSF venous fistulas, which are a recently reported cause of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with SIH caused by CSF venous fistulas who received treatment at our institution. The anatomic details of each fistula were recorded. Attenuation of the veins involved by the fistula was compared with that of adjacent control veins on CT myelography (CTM). Visibility of the CSF venous fistula on CTM and a modified conventional myelography technique we refer to as dynamic myelography was also compared. RESULTS: Twenty-two cases of CSF venous fistula were identified. The fistulas were located between T4 and L1. Ninety percent occurred without a concurrent epidural CSF leak. In most cases (82\%), the CSF venous fistula originated from a nerve root sleeve diverticulum. On CTM, the abnormal veins associated with the CSF venous fistula were seen in a paravertebral location in 45\% of cases, centrally within the epidural venous plexus in 32\%, and lateral to the spine in 23\%. Differences in attenuation between the fistula veins and the control veins was highly statistically significant (p {$<$} 0.0001), with a threshold of 70 HU perfectly discriminating fistulas from normal veins in our series. When both CTM and dynamic myelography were performed, the fistula was identified on both modalities in 88\% of cases. CONCLUSION: CSF venous fistulas are an important cause of SIH that can be detected on both CTM and dynamic myelograph y and may occur without an epidural CSF leak. Familiarity with the imaging characteristics of these lesions is critical to providing appropriate treatment to patients with SIH.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To discuss common myths and misperceptions about spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), focusing on common issues related to diagnosis and treatment, and to review the evidence that contradicts and clarifies these myths. BACKGROUND: Recognition of SIH has increased in recent years. With increasing recognition, however, has come an increased demand for management by neurologists and headache specialists, some of whom have little prior experience with the condition. This dearth of practical experience, and lack of awareness of recent investigations into SIH, produces heterogeneity in diagnostic and treatment pathways, driven in part by outdated, confusing, or unsubstantiated conceptions of the condition. We sought to address this heterogeneity by identifying 10 myths and misperceptions that we frequently encounter when receiving referrals for suspected or confirmed SIH, and to review the literature addressing these topics. METHODS: Ten topics relevant to diagnosis and treatment SIH were generated by the authors. A search for studies addressing SIH was conducted using PubMed and EMBASE, limited to English language only, peer reviewed publications from inception to 2018. Individual case reports were excluded. The resulting studies were reviewed for relevance to the topics in question. RESULTS: The search generated 557 studies addressing SIH; 75 case reports were excluded. Fifty-four studies were considered to be of high relevance to the topics addressed, and were included in the data synthesis. The topics are presented in the form of a narrative review. CONCLUSIONS: The understanding of SIH has evolved over the recent decades, leading to improvements in knowledge about the pathophysiology of the condition, diagnostic strategies, and expanded treatments. Awareness of these changes, and dispelling outdated misconceptions about SIH, is critical to providing appropriate care for patients and guiding future investigations going forward.},

METHODS: We searched the institutional database for all adult patients who underwent Chiari decompression between 1995 and 2007. PFD was offered to all consecutive patients with Chairi-1 malformation during this time period. We excluded patients who underwent re-exploration after initial Chiari-1 decompression elsewhere. Besides the demographic variables, presenting symptoms, neurological and radiographic findings the clinical records were studied for long-term outcomes specifically symptomatic improvement. We defined symptomatic improvement as resolution of all presenting symptoms including pain and/or neurological deficits at the last follow-up. The factors associated with symptom recurrence were also analyzed. RESULTS: We identified 47 patients who underwent PFD for Chiari-1 malformation. Syringomyelia was noted in 36.2\% of patients and the mean tonsilar herniation was 12.6mm. At a mean follow-up of 9.3 years, the symptomatic improvement rate was 60.6\%. There were no operative complications. Repeat posterior fossa decompression was required for 31.9\% patients with symptomatic recurrence at an average of 2.6 years after initial decompression. Fibrotic thickening overlying the dura mater was observed in one-third of these patients. CONCLUSIONS: This case series reports low complication but high long-term symptomatic recurrence rates adults with symptomatic Chiari-1 malformation undergoing PFD.},

Seven cases of extradural arachnoid cysts were treated surgically between the years 1996 to 2002. These patients were analysed retrospectively. The average follow-up period was 32 months. Three patients were males and four were females and their ages ranged from 12 to 35 years. The patients presented with predominant complaint of progressive motor deficits. There were two cysts in the dorsal region, four in the dorsolumbar region and one in the cervicodorsal region. The extradural arachnoid cyst was located posterior to the dural tube and in the midline in six cases and all these cysts had bilateral multiple intervertebral foraminal extensions. In the case with a cervicodorsal cyst, the cyst was anterolateral to the dural tube and there was no foraminal extension. The surgery comprised of wide exposure of the cyst and radical marsupialization or resection of the cyst wall. There was no recurrence of the cyst during the period of follow-up. Radical resection of the walls leads to a lasting cure from extradural arachnoid cyst. The site of communication of the cyst contents with subarachnoid CSF could not be identified during the surgery in the series.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have revealed that some patients with superficial siderosis (SS) show evidence of an intraspinal fluid-filled collection on imaging. Some of these patients also show clinical and/or imaging features of craniospinal hypovolemia related to dural defects. We report a patient with SS whose clinical presentation was suggestive of motor neuron disease and whose history was remarkable for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypovolemia. This report also reviews the literature on the relationship between SS, dural defects, and CSF hypovolemia. CASE REPORT: A 58-year-old left-handed man was evaluated for an 18-month history of progressive imbalance with limb muscle weakness, wasting, and fasciculations. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were remarkable for evidence of SS and diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement similar to that seen in craniospinal hypovolemia. Spine MRI showed a longitudinal intraspinal fluid-filled collection. A dynamic computed tomographic myelogram of the spine showed a CSF leak adjacent to a peripherally calcified disk at the T2-3 level. Following repair of the dural defect the patient noted an improvement in balance and strength and resolution of the fasciculations. A cervical and thoracic spine MRI showed resolution of the intraspinal fluid-filled collection, and a CSF study showed no red blood cells or xanthochromia. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical spectrum of disorders related to dural defects includes craniospinal hypovolemia, SS-related ataxia and impaired hearing, segmental weakness and atrophy with or without hyperreflexia, and spinal cord herniation. The clinical features of these conditions may overlap. Longitudinally extensive ventral dissecting meningoceles can be seen in all these conditions. A dynamic computed tomographic myelogram can identify a dural defect. In some cases the dural defect may result from an osteophyte.},

To date there is a paucity of information on the angiographic and hemodynamic outcome of these procedures. The object of this study was to define the clinical, angiographic, and hemodynamic outcome of placement of unilateral dural sinus stents to treat intracranial venous hypertension in a subgroup of patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for IIH. METHODS: Eighteen consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of IIH were treated with unilateral stent placement in the transverse-sigmoid junction region. All patients had papilledema. All 12 female patients had headaches; 1 of 6 males had headaches previously that disappeared after weight loss. Seventeen patients had elevated opening pressures at lumbar puncture. Twelve patients had opening pressures of 33-55 cm H(2)O. All patients underwent diagnostic cerebral arteriography that showed venous outflow compromise by filling defects in the transverse-sigmoid junction region. All patients underwent intracranial selective venous pressure measurements across the filling defects. Follow-up arteriography was performed in 16 patients and follow-up venography/venous pressure measurements were performed in 15 patients. RESULTS: Initial pressure gradients across the filling defects ranged from 10.5 to 39 mm Hg. Nineteen stent procedures were performed in 18 patients. One patient underwent repeat stent placement for hemodynamic failure. Pressure gradients were reduced in every instance and ranged from 0 to 7 mm Hg after stenting. Fifteen of 16 patients in whom ophthalmological follow-up was performed experienced disappearance of papilledema. Follow-up arteriography in 16 patients at 5-99 months (mean 25.3 months, median 18.5 months) showed patency of all stents without in-stent restenosis. Two patients had filling defects immediately above the stent. Four other patients developed transverse sinus narrowing above the stent without filling defects. One of these patients underwent repeat stent placement because of hemodynamic deterioration. Two of the other 3 patients had hemodynamic deterioration with recurrent pressure gradients of 10.5 and 18 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: All stents remained patent without restenosis. Stent placement is durable and successfully eliminates papilledema in appropriately selected patients. Continuing hemodynamic success in this series was 80\%, and was 87\% with repeat stent placement in 1 patient.},

These 26 cases consisted of 8 intraforaminal or extraforaminal lumbar disc herniations and 18 foraminal nerve root entrapments. The cases with an extreme lateral lumbar disc herniation underwent lateral fenestration or osteoplastic hemilaminectomy without concomitant spinal fusion, and showed excellent operative results. A sufficient selective decompression was achieved with a good clinical result in the cases of lumbar spondylosis without preoperative spinal instability, by lateral fenestration or osteoplastic hemilaminectomy. This result suggests that the selective decompression procedure is recommended for cases with reliable preoperative diagnoses. When an intraspinal lesion makes it difficult to diagnose coexisting foraminal nerve root involvement, decompression of the nerve root canal, approaching from medial to lateral, is recommended. The fusion operation should be performed in cases undergoing even a unilateral total facetectomy, regardless of the patient's old age. A correct preoperative diagnosis is crucial in order to obtain satisfactory operative results.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of anticoagulation reversal and blood pressure (BP) with hematoma enlargement and the effects of OAC resumption. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study at 19 German tertiary care centers (2006-2012) including 1176 individuals for analysis of long-term functional outcome, 853 for analysis of hematoma enlargement, and 719 for analysis of OAC resumption. EXPOSURES: Reversal of anticoagulation during acute phase, systolic BP at 4 hours, and reinitiation of OAC for long-term treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Frequency of hematoma enlargement in relation to international normalized ratio (INR) and BP. Incidence analysis of ischemic and hemorrhagic events with or without OAC resumption. Factors associated with favorable (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-3) vs unfavorable functional outcome. RESULTS: Hemorrhage enlargement occurred in 307 of 853 patients (36.0\%). Reduced rates of hematoma enlargement were associated with reversal of INR levels {$<$}1.3 within 4 hours after admission (43/217 [19.8\%]) vs INR of {$\geq$}1.3 (264/636 [41.5\%]; P\,{$<$}\,.001) and systolic BP {$<$}160 mm Hg at 4 hours (167/504 [33.1\%]) vs {$\geq$}160 mm Hg (98/187 [52.4\%]; P\,{$<$}\,.001). The combination of INR reversal {$<$}1.3 within 4 hours and systolic BP of {$<$}160 mm Hg at 4 hours was associated with lower rates of hematoma enlargement (35/193 [18.1\%] vs 220/498 [44.2\%] not achieving these values; OR, 0.28; 95\% CI, 0.19-0.42; P\,{$<$}\,.001) and lower rates of in-hospital mortality (26/193 [13.5\%] vs 103/498 [20.7\%]; OR, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.37-0.95; P\,=\,.03). OAC was resumed in 172 of 719 survivors (23.9\%). OAC resumption showed fewer ischemic complications (OAC: 9/172 [5.2\%] vs no OAC: 82/547 [15.0\%]; P\,{$<$}\,.001) and not significantly different hemorrhagic complications (OAC: 14/172 [8.1\%] vs no OAC: 36/547 [6.6\%]; P\,=\,.48). Propensity-matched survival analysis in patients with atrial fibrillation who restarted OAC showed a decreased HR of 0.258 (95\% CI, 0.125-0.534; P\,{$<$}\,.001) for long-term mortality. Functional long-term outcome was unfavorable in 786 of 1083 patients (72.6\%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with OAC-associated ICH, reversal of INR {$<$}1.3 within 4 hours and systolic BP {$<$}160 mm Hg at 4 hours were associated with lower rates of hematoma enlargement, and resumption of OAC therapy was associated with lower risk of ischemic events.

OBJECTIVE: To discuss the presentation and evaluation of adult patients with acquired spondylolytic spondylolisthesis of low-grade severity and to review surgical treatment options. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Low-grade adult acquired spondylolytic spondylolisthesis is one of the most common forms of spondylolisthesis. METHODS: Literature review. RESULTS: Adults with symptomatic low-grade spondylolytic spondylolisthesis are treated predominantly nonoperatively, with activity modification, physiotherapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and local injections. Surgical treatment is reserved for individuals with intractable back pain and/or radicular symptoms. A number of surgical options exist, including direct pars repair, and fusion with or without decompression. Fusion can be achieved by providing anterior column support alone, posterior support alone, or a combined circumferential approach; the optimal method by which fusion should be achieved has not been established. CONCLUSIONS: The management of low-grade acquired spondylolytic spondylolisthesis requires a thoughtful and individualized approach, recognizing the frequently benign natural history of the deformity and the potentially good clinical outcomes from surgery in those select patients with intolerable back and leg pain. While fusion is the mainstay of surgical management, a prospective randomized study would be extremely useful to delineate the optimal fusion technique.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: The natural history of syringomyelia is highly unpredictable, and some patients experience improvement or stabilization without surgery. However, the mechanisms of the formation and spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia remain controversial. This report concerns two patients with syringomyelia who demonstrated spontaneous reductions in syrinx size, accompanied by symptomatic improvement. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: One patient was a 10-year-old girl with syringomyelia associated with a tight cisterna magna and basilar impression, who demonstrated a spontaneous decrease in syrinx size, accompanied by symptomatic improvement, in 22 months. The other patient was a 39-year-old man with syringomyelia associated with a Chiari I malformation, who demonstrated a spontaneous reduction in syrinx size and neurological improvement, accompanied by elevation of the cerebellar tonsils, 6 months after diagnosis. INTERVENTION: The patients were monitored. CONCLUSION: The mechanisms of spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia, as well as the factors leading to the cerebrospinal fluid flow disturbances that cause syringomyelia, may vary.

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective radiographic and clinical analysis. OBJECTIVE: Investigate the relationship between spino-pelvic parameters and patient self reported outcomes on adult subjects with spinal deformities. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: It is becoming increasingly recognized that the study of spinal alignment should include pelvic position. While pelvic incidence determines lumbar lordosis, pelvic tilt (PT) is a positional parameter reflecting compensation to spinal deformity. Correlation between plumbline offset (sagittal vertical axis [SVA]) and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) measures has been demonstrated, but such a study is lacking for PT. METHODS: This prospective study was carried out on 125 adult patients suffering from spinal deformity (mean age: 57 years). Full-length free-standing radiographs including the spine and pelvis were available for all patients. HRQOL instruments included: Oswestry Disability Index, Short Form-12, Scoliosis Research Society. Correlation analysis between radiographic spinopelvic parameters and HRQOL measures was pursued. RESULTS: Correlation analysis revealed no significance pertaining to coronal plane parameters. Significant sagittal plane correlations were identified. SVA and truncal inclination measured by T1 spinopelvic inclination (T1-SPI) (angle between T1-hip axis and vertical) correlated with: Scoliosis Research Society (appearance, activity, total score), Oswestry Disability Index, and Short Form-12 (physical component score). Correlation coefficients ranged from 0.42 {$<$} r {$<$} 0.55 (P {$<$} 0.0001). T1-SPI revealed greater correlation with HRQOL compared to SVA. PT showed correlation with HRQOL (0.28 {$<$} r {$<$} 0.42) and with SVA (r = 0.64, P {$<$} 0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study confirms that pelvic position measured via PT correlates with HRQOL in the setting of adult deformity. High values of PT express compensatory pelvic retroversion for sagittal spinal malalignment. This study also demonstrates significant T1-SPI correlation with HRQOL measures and outperforms SVA. This parameter carries the advantage of being an angular measurement which avoids the error inherent in measuring offsets in noncalibrated radiographs.},

Bone removal involves the most lateral part of the inferior occipital squama and the posterior arch of C1. Drilling of various portions of the occipital condyle further increases the exposure. Transposition of the vertebral artery is seldom required. The far-lateral approach allows a tangential, unobstructed view of the lateroventral cervicomedullary area and can be applied effectively to manage with a heterogeneous spectrum of pathological lesions involving this area.

Fifty-two patients had closed vertebral fractures and 10 had gunshot wounds. The spinal cord was involved in 44 patients, and the cauda equina in 18. A spinal subarachnoid block was demonstrated in 17 of 57 preoperative gas myelograms. Evoked potential recordings, although related to preception of joint rotation, tended to reflect the overall neurological condition and had some prognostic value. Significant improvement followed surgery in 46 patients with incomplete neurological lesions, and one was transiently worse. Before operation 18 patients were able to walk; nine with assistance and nine without. After operation 47 patients were able to walk; 12 with assistance and 35 without. Adequate bladder function was present in 17 patients before surgery, and in 44 after surgery. A laminectomy had been done previously in 16 patients, 11 of whom improved significantly after anterior resection. Spine fusions were required in 26 patients, five of whom had a prior laminectomy. The major factor in the pathogenesis of the incomplete neurological deficit appeared to be distortion of the cord and roots by displaced bone and disc.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a comprehensive English language systematic literature review of proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) and proximal junctional failure (PJF), concentrating on incidence, risk factors, health related quality of life impact, prevention strategy, and classification systems. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: PJK and PJF are well described clinical pathologies and are a frequent cause of revision surgery. The development of a PJK classification that correlates with clinical outcomes and guides treatment decisions and possible prevention strategies would be of significant benefit to patients and surgeons. METHODS: The phrases "proximal junctional," "proximal junctional kyphosis," and "proximal junctional failure" were used as search terms in PubMed for all years up to 2014 to identify all articles that included at least one of these terms. RESULTS: Fifty-three articles were identified overall. Eighteen articles assessed for risk factors. Eight studies specifically reviewed prevention strategies. There were no randomized prospective studies. There were 3 published studies that have attempted to classify PJK. The reported incidence of PJK ranged widely, from 5\% to 46\% in patients undergoing spinal instrumentation and fusion for adult spinal deformity. It is reported that 66\% of PJK occurs within 3 months and 80\% within 18 months after surgery. The reported revision rates due to PJK range from 13\% to 55\%. Modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors for PJK have been characterized. CONCLUSION: PJK and PJF affect many patients after long segment instrumentation after the correction of adult spinal deformity. The epidemiology and risk factors for the disease are well defined. A PJK and PJF scoring system may help describe the severity of disease and guide the need for revision surgery. The development and prospective validation of a PJK classification system is important considering the prevalence of the problem and its clinical and economic impact. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Type 1 Chiari malformation (CM-I) is a craniospinal disorder historically defined by cerebellar tonsillar position greater than 3-5 mm below the foramen magnum (FM). This definition has come under question because quantitative measurements of cerebellar herniation do not always correspond with symptom severity. Researchers have proposed several additional radiographic diagnostic criteria based on dynamic motion of fluids and/or tissues. The present study objective was to determine if cardiac-related craniocaudal spinal cord tissue displacement is an accurate indicator of the presence of CM-I and if tissue displacement is altered with decompression. METHODS: A cohort of 20 symptomatic patients underwent decompression surgery. Fifteen healthy volunteers were recruited for comparison with the CM-I group. Axial phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) measurements were collected before and after surgery at the FM with cranial-caudal velocity encoding and 20 frames per cardiac cycle with retrospective reconstruction. Spinal cord motion (SCM) at the FM was quantified based on the peak-to-peak integral of average spinal cord velocity. RESULTS: Tissue motion for the presurgical group was significantly greater than controls (P~= 0.0009). Motion~decreased after surgery (P~= 0.058) with an effect size of~-0.151 mm and a standard error of 0.066 mm. Postoperatively, no statistical difference from controls in bulk displacement at the FM was found (P~= 0.200) after post hoc testing using the Tukey adjustment for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: These results support SCM measurement by PC-MRI as a possible noninvasive radiographic diagnostic for CM-I. Dynamic measurement of SCM provides unique diagnostic information about CM-I alongside static quantification of tonsillar position and other intracranial morphometrics.},

The study included 81 patients, of whom 51 had a history of previous low back surgery. We excluded patients with suspected or confirmed nonunion. In the fusion group, the 27 patients who were pain free after the procedure were compared to the 54 patients with residual pain. Thirty patients had pain only or primarily when they were standing immobile, 18 when they were sitting immobile, and six in both positions. Measurements were done on full-length lateral radiographs of the spine, with the patient standing according to Duval Beaup\`ere criteria. The subgroup with postfusion pain was characterized at baseline by a more vertical sacrum with less sacral tilt (ST) (P {$<$} 0.0062) and more pelvic tilt (PT) (P {$<$} 0.0160). PT at last follow-up (PT fu) correlated with the presence of postfusion pain (NP: P = 0.0003). In the patients with postfusion pain, PT was almost twice the normal value. ST at last follow-up (ST fu) in the standing position was also correlated with the presence of postfusion pain (P {$<$} 0.0001) indicating that the sacrum remained abnormally vertical in the subjects with postfusion pain. Using logistic regression, the only prognostic factor for residual pain at last follow-up was ST fu. Both at pre-operative evaluation and at last follow-up, patients with pain in the standing position or in both the standing and sitting positions were characterized at pre-operative status by a more vertical sacrum with less sacral tilt. The results of this study indicate that, achieving a strong fusion should not be the only goal. Appropriate position of the fused vertebrae is also of paramount importance to minimize muscle work during posture maintenance. The main risk is failing to correct or to causing excessive pelvic retroversion with a vertical sacrum leading to a sagittal alignment that replicates the sitting position. This situation is often accompanied by loss of lumbar lordosis and adversely affects stiff or degenerative hips.},

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 573 contrast-enhanced CT scans and 100 contrast-enhanced MR studies of the brain for the presence of discrete filling defects within the venous sinuses. An anatomic study of the dural sinuses of 29 cadavers was performed, and the location, appearance, and histologic findings of focal protrusions into the dural sinus lumen (arachnoid granulations) were assessed and compared with the imaging findings. RESULTS: Discrete filling defects within the dural sinuses were found on 138 (24\%) of the contrast-enhanced CT examinations. A total of 168 defects were found, the majority (92\%) within the transverse sinuses. One third were isodense and two thirds were hypodense relative to brain parenchyma. Patients with filling defects were older than patients without filling defects (mean age, 46 years versus 40 years). Discrete intrasinus signal foci were noted on 13 (13\%) of the contrast-enhanced MR studies. The foci followed the same distribution as the filling defects seen on CT scans and were isointense to hypointense on T1-weighted images, variable in signal on balanced images, and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Transverse sinus arachnoid granulations were noted adjacent to venous entrance sites in 62\% and 85\% of the CT and MR examinations, respectively. Arachnoid granulations were found in 19 (66\%) of the cadaveric specimens, in a similar distribution as that seen on the imaging studies. CONCLUSION: Discrete filling defects, consistent with arachnoid granulations, may be seen in the dural sinuses on 24\% of contrast-enhanced CT scans and on 13\% of MR studies. They are focal, well-defined, and typically located within the lateral transverse sinuses adjacent to venous entrance sites. They should not be mistaken for sinus thrombosis or intrasinus tumor, but recognized as normal structures.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four grades were developed for lumbar foraminal stenosis on the basis of sagittal MRI. Grade 0 refers to the absence of foraminal stenosis; grade 1 refers to mild foraminal stenosis showing perineural fat obliteration in the two opposing directions, vertical or transverse; grade 2 refers to moderate foraminal stenosis showing perineural fat obliteration in the four directions without morphologic change, both vertical and transverse directions; and grade 3 refers to severe foraminal stenosis showing nerve root collapse or morphologic change. A total of 576 foramina in 96 patients were analyzed (from L3-L4 to L5-S1). Two experienced radiologists independently assessed the sagittal MR images. Interobserver agreement between the two radiologists and intraobserver agreement by one reader were analyzed using kappa statistics. RESULTS: According to reader 1, grade 1 foraminal stenosis was found in 33 foramina, grade 2 in six, and grade 3 in seven. According to reader 2, grade 1 foraminal stenosis was found in 32 foramina, grade 2 in six, and grade 3 in eight. Interobserver agreement in the grading of foraminal stenosis between the two readers was found to be nearly perfect (kappa value: right L3-L4, 1.0; left L3-L4, 0.905; right L4-L5, 0.929; left L4-L5, 0.942; right L5-S1, 0.919; and left L5-S1, 0.909). In intraobserver agreement by reader 1, grade 1 foraminal stenosis was found in 34 foramina, grade 2 in eight, and grade 3 in seven. Intraobserver agreement in the grading of foraminal stenosis was also found to be nearly perfect (kappa value: right L3-L4, 0.883; left L3-L4, 1.00; right L4-L5, 0.957; left L4-L5, 0.885; right L5-S1, 0.800; and left L5-S1, 0.905).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spinal epidural arachnoid cysts (EAC) are rare and may present with myelopathy, which can be completely curable with surgery. The majority of investigators believe that the repairment of dural defect is important to treat EAC. However, the necessity of excising EACs remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to find a reasonable surgical technique for treatment of EACs after considering the clinical outcome, recurrence, and complications. METHODS: The data from 44 operations in the literature and eight cases from our own experience were analyzed. This data included the surgical method, patient characteristics, level and size of the EAC, global assessment of the clinical outcomes, and the incidence of recurrence. RESULTS: The recurrence rate was 2.0 \% and 66.7 \% in the patients who underwent repair of the dural defect and in those failed to repair of the dural defect, respectively (p = 0.007). The recurrence rate was 8.3 \% and 3.6 \% in patients who underwent complete EAC excision totally, and those who underwent EAC fenestration only, respectively (p = 0.590). The clinical outcome in patients with repaired dural defects was significantly better than that in patients with unrepaired dural defects (2.61 vs.1.67) (p = 0.027). The clinical outcome score was 2.42 and 2.68 in patients who underwent complete EAC excision and those who underwent EAC fenestration only, respectively (p = 0.158). The mean EAC length was 5.04 vertebral body levels (range, 2-13). Six of the 51 patients (11.7 \%) had multiple EACs. CONCLUSIONS: Total excision of EACs may have little benefit in terms of cyst recurrence and clinical outcome. The procedure for EAC resection carries a risk of complications such as kyphosis. If EAC resection is performed, we suggest that a tailored short-level laminotomy be used to allow for the repair of dural defects. Particularly in patients with small EAC, a partial hemilaminectomy with dural defect repair may be a possible method to reduce complications.},

A 21-year-old man visited complaining of progressive neck pain and tingling sensation in both hands. Magnetic resonance imaging of his spine revealed C1-2 ventral intradural mass. When the dura was opened, the intradural tumor was placed behind spinal accessary nerves. The tumor was partially exposed only after some accessary nerves had been cut. When internal debulking was performing, unexpected bleeding was noted and it was difficult to control because of narrow surgical field and hypervascularity. Intraoperative spinal angiography and embolization were performed. The tumor was completely removed after embolization. Pathological diagnosis was consistent with hemangiopericytoma. When surgeons meet a flesh-red tumor that bleeds unexpectedly during surgery, hemangiopericytoma may be considered. When feeder control is hard due to reciprocal location of spinal cord, the tumor, and feeders, intraoperative angiography and embolization may be a possible option.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Unruptured intracranial aneurysms are now being detected with increasing frequency in clinical practice. Results of the largest studies, including those of the International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms, indicate that surgical and endovascular treatments are rarely justified in small aneurysms. However, we have encountered several cases of rupture of small and very small aneurysms in our clinical practice. This retrospective study analyzed the incidence and clinical characteristics of very small ruptured aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 200 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage between January 2012 and December 2014 were reviewed. Various factors were analyzed, including the aneurysm location and size as well as the associated risk factors. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 56.31 {$\pm$} 13.78 (range, 25-89) years, and the male to female ratio was 1:2.1. There were 94 (47\%) small-sized ({$<$} 5 mm), 91 (45.5\%) medium-sized (5-9.9 mm), and 15 large-sized ({$>$} 10 mm) aneurysms. Of these, 30 (15\%) aneurysms were very small-sized ({$<$} 3 mm). The most frequent site of aneurysms was the anterior communicating artery (ACoA). However, the proportion of aneurysms at the ACoA was significantly high in very small aneurysms (53.3\%, p = 0.013). Hypertension was a significant risk factor for rupture of very small aneurysms (p {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSION: About half of our cases of ruptured aneurysms involved the rupture of small and very small aneurysms. The most common site of rupture of very small aneurysm was the ACoA. Rupture of small and very small aneurysms is unpredictable, and treatment may be considered in selected high-risk patients according to factors such as young age, ACoA location, and hypertension.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Although posterior decompressive surgery is widely used to treat patients with cervical myelopathy and multilevel ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), a poor outcome is anticipated if the sagittal alignment is kyphotic (or K-line negative). Accordingly, it is mandatory to perform anterior decompression and fusion in patients with cervical kyphosis. However, it can be difficult to perform anterior surgery because of the high risk of complications. This present report proposes a novel ``greenstick fracture technique'' to change the K-line from negative to positive in patients with cervical myelopathy, OPLL, and kyphotic deformity. METHODS Four patients with cervical myelopathy, continuous-type OPLL, and kyphotic sagittal alignment (who were K-line negative) were indicated for surgery. Posterior laminectomy and lateral mass screw insertions using a posterior approach were performed, followed by anterior surgery. Multilevel discectomy and thinning of the OPLL mass by bur drilling was performed, then an intentional greenstick fracture at each disc level was made to convert the cervical K-line from negative to positive. Finally, posterior instrumentation using a rod was carried out to maintain cervical lordosis. RESULTS MRI showed complete decompression of the cord by posterior migration in all cases, which had been caused by cervical lordosis. Restoration of neurological defects was confirmed at the 1-year follow-up assessment. No specific complications were identified that were associated with this technique. CONCLUSIONS A greenstick fracture technique may be effective and safe when applied to patients with cervical myelopathy, continuous-type OPLL, and kyphotic deformity (K-line negative). However, further studies with more cases will be required to reveal its generalizability and safety.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify advantages and disadvantages of long versus short fusion for patients with Spinal stenosis with Balanced de novo degenerative lumbar Scoliosis without substantial Sagittal imbalance (SBSS), and to determine whether short fusions and long fusions have different curve progression after surgeries and differences in operative characteristics. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Patients with SBSS usually undergo short limited fusion or long fusion with curve correction. There is debate regarding whether short fusion is insufficient for SBSS for prevention scoliosis progression. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library was performed to find studies assessing the comparison of surgical techniques for SBSS. We included all direct comparative studies comparing short and long fusion and extracted data about scoliosis progression, changes in the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), perioperative outcomes, and complication rates. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: We included data from six studies involving 362 patients (short fusion, 202 patients; long fusion, 160 patients). Both the short fusion and the long fusion groups showed decreased Cobb angle (short, 22.38\textdegree -11.69\textdegree; long, 30.74\textdegree -12.77\textdegree ) and C7 plumb at the final follow-up. The long fusion group showed a substantial decrease in Cobb angle (WMD, 8.94; 95\% CI, 2.55-15.33) and in C7 plumb (WMD, 5.90; 95\% CI, -0.39-12.18), compared to the short fusion group. At final follow-up, ODI had decreased similarly in both groups (WMD, 1.70; 95\% CI, -13.04-9.65). The short fusion group showed advantages including decreased blood loss (mean difference, 739.9{$\mkern1mu$}mL) and shorter operative time (mean difference, 68.0 minutes) compared to the long fusion group. CONCLUSION: Short fusion may be a reasonable option for patients with SBSS and at low risk for curve progression. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1.},

These have included studies highlighting important species-specific variations in the different functions mediated by the CST. In the primate, the most characteristic feature is direct cortico-motoneuronal (CM) control of muscles, particularly of hand and finger muscles. This system, which is unique to dexterous primates, is probably at its most advanced level in humans. We now know much more about the origin of the CM system within the cortical motor network, and its connectivity within the spinal cord has been quantified. We have learnt much more about how the CM system works in parallel with other spinal circuits receiving input from the CST and how the CST functions alongside other brainstem motor pathways. New work in the mouse has provided fascinating insights into the contribution of the CM system to dexterity. Finally, accumulating evidence for the involvement of CM projections in motor neuron disease has highlighted the importance of advances in basic neuroscience for our understanding and possible treatment of a devastating neurological disease.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of syringomyelia associated with Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) is unclear. Theories of pathogenesis suggest the cerebellar tonsils may obstruct CSF flow or alter pressure gradients, or their motion might act as a piston to increase CSF pressure in the spinal subarachnoid space. This study was performed to measure cerebellar tonsillar and hindbrain motion in CM-I and assess the potential contributions to syrinx formation. METHODS: Sixty-four CM-I patients and 25 controls were retrospectively selected from a clinical database, and all subjects had undergone cardiac-gated cine balanced fast-field echo MRI. There were a total of 36 preoperative CM-I scans, which consisted of 15 patients with and 21 patients without syringomyelia. Nineteen patients underwent paired pre- and postoperative imaging. Anteroposterior (AP) and superoinferior (SI) movements of the tip of the cerebellar tonsils, obex, fastigium of the fourth ventricle, pontomedullary junction, and cervicomedullary junction were measured. The distance between the fastigium and tip of the tonsils was used to calculate tonsillar tissue strain ({$\Delta$}i/i0). RESULTS: CM-I patients had significantly greater cerebellar tonsillar motion in both the AP and SI directions than controls (AP +0.34 mm [+136\%], p {$<$} 0.001; SI +0.49 mm [+163\%], p {$<$} 0.001). This motion decreased after posterior fossa decompression (AP -0.20 mm [-33\%], p = 0.001; SI -0.29 mm [-36\%]; p {$<$} 0.001), but remained elevated above control levels (AP +56\%, p = 0.021; SI +67\%, p = 0.015). Similar trends were seen for all other tracked landmarks. There were no significant differences in the magnitude or timing of motion throughout the hindbrain between CM-I patients with and without syringomyelia. Increased tonsillar tissue strain correlated with Valsalva headaches (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Cerebellar tonsillar motion may be a potential marker of CM-I and may have use in tailoring surgical procedures. The lack of association with syringomyelia suggests that tonsillar motion alone is not the driver of syrinx formation. Tonsillar tissue strain may play a part in the pathophysiology of Valsalva headaches.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Cerebral venous pressure gradient (CVPG) from dural venous sinus stenosis is implicated in headache syndromes such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The incidence of CVPG in headache patients has not been reported. METHODS The authors reviewed all cerebral venograms with manometry performed for headache between January 2008 and May 2015. Patient demographics, headache etiology, intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements, and radiographic and manometric results were recorded. CVPG was defined as a difference {$\geq$} 8 mm Hg by venographic manometry. RESULTS One hundred sixty-four venograms were performed in 155 patients. There were no procedural complications. Ninety-six procedures (58.5\%) were for patients with IIH. The overall incidence of CVPG was 25.6\% (42 of 164 procedures): 35.4\% (34 of 96 procedures) in IIH patients and 11.8\% (8 of 68 procedures) in non-IIH patients. Sixty procedures (36.6\%) were performed in patients with preexisting shunts. Seventy-seven patients (49.7\%) had procedures preceded by an ICP measurement within 4 weeks of venography, and in 66 (85.7\%) of these patients, the ICP had been found to be elevated. CVPG was seen in 8.3\% (n = 5) of the procedures in the 60 patients with a preexisting shunt and in 0\% (n = 0) of the 11 procedures in the 77 patients with normal ICP (p {$<$} 0.001 for both). Noninvasive imaging (MR venography, CT venography) was assessed prior to venography in 112 (68.3\%) of 164 cases, and dural venous sinus abnormalities were demonstrated in 73 (65.2\%) of these cases; there was a trend toward CVPG (p = 0.07). Multivariate analysis demonstrated an increased likelihood of CVPG in patients with IIH (OR 4.97, 95\% CI 1.71-14.47) and a decreased likelihood in patients with a preexisting shunt (OR 0.09, 95\% CI 0.02-0.44). CONCLUSIONS CVPG is uncommon in IIH patients, rare in those with preexisting shunts, and absent in those with normal ICP.},

The objectives of this study were to compare the accuracy of conventional metrizamide myelography with CT metrizamide myelography and to study indirectly the hydrodynamics of CSF flow in syringomyelia by comparing the sequential enhancement patterns of the spinal cords and cord cavities in the different groups of patients. Twenty-five patients underwent conventional metrizamide myelography immediately before CT metrizamide myelography, and one patient underwent CT metrizamide myelography only. Scans were obtained 1-2 hr, 4-8 hr, and 12-24 hr after injection of metrizamide, but not all patients were scanned during all three intervals. CT metrizamide myelography was found to be more sensitive than conventional metrizamide myelography in the diagnosis of both Arnold-Chiari I malformation and syringomyelia. Performing just an immediate and a delayed scan was found to be more cost-effective than doing all three scans. Contrary to previous reports, it was found that delayed (12-24 hr) scans demonstrated more syrinx cavities than intermediate ones. In studying the sequential enhancement patterns of the spinal cords and cord cavities, some interesting trends were observed that tend to support the theories of Aboulker and of Ball and Dayan of transneural passage of CSF into cord cavities in syringomyelia.},

The brain and spinal cord are dynamic structures that move with each heartbeat due to transmitted arterial pulse waves. Conventional MRI sequences do not allow anatomic evaluation of the pulsatile movement of the neural structures in the subarachnoid space due to limitations in temporal resolution. Cine bSSFP MRI uses cardiac gating to evaluate dynamically the brain and spinal cord with high contrast and temporal resolution.Cine bSSFP can be used in the evaluation of idiopathic syringomyelia to assess an underlying treatable cause, including arachnoid bands, which are usually not well visualized with conventional MR sequences due to motion artifact. This MRI technique is also useful in the evaluation of intraspinal and intracranial arachnoid cysts and the degree of mass effect on the cord. Other applications include preoperative and postoperative evaluation of Chiari I malformation and the evaluation of lateral ventricular asymmetry. The major limitation of cine bSSFP is the presence of banding artifacts, which can be reduced by shimming and modifying other scan parameters.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. METHODS: We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number. RESULTS: Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56\% were male. The majority of cases (55\%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6\% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95\% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95\% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95\% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk. (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.).},

The aim of this study was to explore efficacy and feasibility of precision treatment of ALDS with selective nerve root block. METHODS: From January 2014 to January 2016, a retrospective study of 23 patients with ALDS treated with precision short-segment surgery with at least 2-year follow-up was performed. Fixation segment was determined by selective nerve root block. Visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were evaluated preoperatively and at 2-year follow-up. Radiographic measurements included Cobb angle of lumbar curve, lumbar lordosis, sacrum slope, and pelvic tilt. Radiographic evaluation of fusion integrity was performed based on Bridwell interbody fusion grading system at final follow-up. RESULTS: Mean follow-up time was 25.2 {$\pm$} 1.4 months. Average lumbar curve was 21.6\textdegree{} {$\pm$} 7.4\textdegree{} preoperatively and 11.2\textdegree{} {$\pm$} 6.5\textdegree{} at final follow-up (P {$<$} 0.01), with correction rate of 48.1\%. Lumbar lordosis changed from~-37.1\textdegree{} {$\pm$} 12.9\textdegree{} to~-42.1\textdegree{} {$\pm$} 10.5\textdegree{} at final follow-up (P {$<$} 0.01). Mean visual analog scale back pain scores decreased from 6.0 {$\pm$} 1.8 preoperatively to 1.5 {$\pm$} 0.8 at final follow-up (P {$<$} 0.01), and mean visual analog scale leg pain scores decreased from 8.1 {$\pm$} 0.6 preoperatively to 1.3 {$\pm$} 1.3 at final follow-up (P {$<$} 0.01). Oswestry Disability Index score improved from 60.9\% {$\pm$} 15.7\% preoperatively to 22.1\% {$\pm$} 11.6\% at final follow-up (P~{$<~$}0.01). All patients achieved grade I fusion at final evaluation. One patient (4\%) needed further surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Precision treatment of ALDS with selective nerve root block can achieve favorable clinical outcomes and good fusion with less surgical injury and low complications.

CONCLUSIONS: Decompressive surgery is indicated in patients in whom symptomatic thoracic spinal cord compression is caused by intruding OLF. Magnetic resonance imaging can provide sufficient clues for the diagnosis of thoracic OLF. Higher preoperative modified JOA scores of 3 and 4 are positively correlated with better postoperatiVe functional recovery than lower scores. Surgery should be performed as soon as possible before independent ambulatory function is impaired.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Posterior fossa decompression without (PFD) or with duraplasty (PFDD) for the treatment of type 1 Chiari malformation (CM-1) is controversial. We thus performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies to assess the effect on clinical and imaging improvement, operative time, complications, and recurrence rate between PFD and PFDD in patients with CM-1. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Knowledge, and ClinicalTrials.gov for retrospective or prospective studies comparing PFD with PFDD. Our main end points were clinical and imaging improvement, operative time, complications, and recurrence rate. We assessed pooled data by use of a fixed-effects or random-effects model according to the between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: Of 214 identified studies, 13 were eligible and were included in our analysis (N~= 3481 patients). Compared with PFD, PFDD led to a mean greater increase in operative time than did PFD [standardized mean difference, -2.35; 95\% confidence interval [CI], (-2.70 to -1.99)], a higher likelihood of clinical improvement in patients with syringomyelia (relative risk [RR], 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.49-0.98), no increased RR of clinical improvement in patients without syringomyelia, no increased RR of imaging improvement, but an increased RR of cerebrospinal fluid-related complications (RR, 0.29; 95\% CI, 0.15-0.58), cerebrospinal fluid leak, aseptic meningitis, pseudomeningocele, and a decreased likelihood of recurrence rate. CONCLUSIONS: PFDD can be an optimal surgical strategy because of its higher clinical improvement and lower recurrence rate in the patients with syringomyelia. In patients without syringomyelia, PFD can be a preferred choice because of its similar clinical improvement and lower costs. Future randomized studies with large numbers and the power to provide illumination for surgical decision making in CM-1 are warranted.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The effect of craniovertebral decompression surgery on CSF flow dynamics in patients with Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) has been incompletely characterized. The authors used computational fluid dynamics to calculate the effect of decompression surgery on CSF flow dynamics in the posterior fossa and upper cervical spinal canal. METHODS: Oscillatory flow was simulated in idealized 3D models of the normal adult and the CM-I subarachnoid spaces (both previously described) and in 3 models of CM-I post-craniovertebral decompressions. The 3 postoperative models were created from the CM model by virtually modifying the CM model subarachnoid space to simulate surgical decompressions of different magnitudes. Velocities and pressures were computed with the Navier-Stokes equations in Star-CD for multiple cycles of CSF flow oscillating at 80 cycles/min. Pressure gradients and velocities were compared for 8 levels extending from the posterior fossa to the C3-4 level. Relative pressures and peak velocities were plotted by level from the posterior fossa to C3-4. The heterogeneity of flow velocity distribution around the spinal cord was compared between models. RESULTS: Peak systolic velocities were generally lower in the postoperative models than in the preoperative CM model. With the 2 larger surgical defects, peak systolic velocities were brought closer to normal model velocities (equal values at C-3 and C-4) than with the smallest surgical defect. For the smallest defect, peak velocities were decreased, but not to levels in the normal model. In the postoperative models, heterogeneity in flow velocity distribution around the spinal cord increased from normal model levels as the degree of decompression increased. Pressures in the 5 models differed in magnitude and in pattern. Pressure gradients along the spinal canal in the normal and CM models were nonlinear, with steeper gradients below C3-4 than above. The CM model had a steeper pressure gradient than the normal model above C3-4 and the same gradient below. The postoperative models had lower pressure gradients than the CM model above C2-3. The most conservative decompression had lower pressure gradients than the normal model above C2-3. The two larger decompression defects had CSF pressure gradients below those in the normal model above C2-3. These 2 models had a less steep gradient above C-3 and a steeper gradient below. CONCLUSIONS: In computer simulations, craniovertebral surgical defects generally diminished CSF velocities and CSF pressures.},

Most reports describe such cysts communicating with the intrathecal subarachnoid space through a small defect in the dura. The authors describe the case of a child who presented with spinal cord compression caused by a large spinal extradural arachnoid cyst that did not communicate with the intradural subarachnoid space. An 11-year-old girl presented with urinary urgency, progressive lower-extremity weakness, myelopathy, and severe gait ataxia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine demonstrated a large extradural arachnoid cyst extending from T-8 to T-12. The patient underwent a thoracic laminoplasty for en bloc resection of the spinal extradural arachnoid cyst. Intraoperatively, the dura was intact and there was no evidence of communication into the intradural subarachnoid space. Postoperatively, the patient's motor strength and ambulation improved immediately, and no subsequent cerebrospinal fluid leak occurred. Noncommunicating spinal extradural arachnoid cysts are extremely rare lesions that can cause spinal cord compression in children. Because the dura remains intact, they can be removed entirely without subsequent dural repair. The authors review the literature and discuss the proposed underlying mechanisms of formation of these arachnoid cysts.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: About 50\% - 70\% of patients with Chiari malformation I (CMI) presented with syringomyelia (SM), which is supposed to be related to abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow around the foramen magnum. The aim of this study was to investigate the cerebrospinal fluid dynamics at levels of the aqueduct and upper cervical spine in patients with CMI associated with SM, and to discuss the possible mechanism of formation of SM. METHODS: From January to April 2004, we examined 10 adult patients with symptomatic CMI associated with SM and 10 healthy volunteers by phase-contrast MRI. CSF flow patterns were evaluated at seven regions of interest (ROI): the aqueduct and ventral and dorsal subarachnoid spaces of the spine at levels of the cerebellar tonsil, C2 - 3, and C5 - 6. The CSF flow waveforms were analyzed by measuring CSF circulation time, durations and maximum velocities of cranial- and caudal-directed flows, and the ratio between the two maximum velocities. Data were analyzed by t test using SPSS 11.5. RESULTS: We found no definite communication between the fourth ventricle and syringomyelia by MRI in the 10 patients. In both the groups, we observed cranial-directed flow of CSF in the early cardiac systolic phase, which changed the direction from cranial to caudal from the middle systolic phase to the early diastolic phase, and then turned back in cranial direction in the late diastolic phase. The CSF flow disappeared at the dorsal ROI at the level of C2 - 3 in 3 patients and 1 volunteer, and at the level of C5 - 6 in 6 patients and 3 volunteers. The durations of CSF circulation at all the ROIs were significantly shorter in the patients than those in the healthy volunteers (P = 0.014 at the midbrain aqueduct, P = 0.019 at the inferior margin of the cerebellar tonsil, P = 0.014 at the level of C2 - 3, and P = 0.022 at the level of C5 - 6). No significant difference existed between the two groups in the initial point and duration of the caudal-directed CSF flow during a cardiac cycle at all the ROIs. The maximum velocities of both cranial- and caudal-directed CSF flows were significantly higher in the patients than those in the volunteers at the aqueduct (P = 0.018 and P = 0.007) and ventral ROI at the inferior margin of the cerebellar tonsil (P {$<$} 0.001 and P = 0.002), as so did the maximum velocities of the caudal-directed flow in the ventral and dorsal ROIs at the level of C2 - 3 (P = 0.004; P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The direction of CSF flow changes in accordance with cardiac cycle. The syringomyelia in patients with CMI may be due to the decreased circulation time and abnormal dynamics of the CSF in the upper cervical segment. The decompression of the foramen magnum with dural plasty is an alternative for patients with CMI associated with SM.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features, radiological characteristics and surgical results of degenerative lumbar scoliosis (DLS). METHODS: One hundred and twelve cases of DLS treated surgically from June 2001 to February 2006 were retrospectively reviewed for clinical features, characteristics of nerve root compression and imaging presentations. According to the preoperative clinical manifestations and imaging findings, different surgical modalities were performed, including simple nerve decompression and decompression with short or long posterior fusion (less or more than three segments, respectively). RESULTS: The mean age of 47 male and 65 female patients was 54.7 years. Clinical manifestations included lower back pain (76.8\%), radiculopathy (79.5\%) and claudication (48.2\%). Plain lumbar radiograph showed right scoliosis in 87 and left scoliosis in the other 25 cases; the Cobb angle was 10\textdegree -46\textdegree; the apex of scoliosis mostly located at L3 (48.2\%); L3 and L4 nerve roots were usually compressed on the concave side and L5 and S1 nerve roots on the convex side. The Cobb angle and physiologic lordosis angle of patients who underwent multi-segment ({$>$}3 segments) fusion improved to a greater extent than did that of patients who had simple decompression without fusion. A mean 5.7-year follow-up showed that the average improvement in Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores was 32.6, 26.3 and 13.5 for long segment fusion, short segment fusion and simple decompression without fusion, respectively. CONCLUSION: Decompression surgery with or without fusion, the main purpose of which is to relieve nerve root compression and stabilize the spinal column, is an effective treatment for chronic DLS. The treatment should be individualized according to the patient's age, general and economic factors, severity of deformity and other coexisting lumbar degenerative disorders.},

  abstract = {Syringomyelia is associated with Chiari I malformation, although the mechanistic link is unclear. Studies have suggested that cerebrospinal fluid enters the spinal cord via the perivascular spaces, and that changes in the timing of the subarachnoid pressures may increase flow into the spinal cord. This study aims to determine how Chiari malformation and syringomyelia alter the subarachnoid space pressures and hence perivascular flow. Subject-specific models of healthy controls (N\,=\,9), Chiari patients with (N\,=\,7) and without (N\,=\,8) syringomyelia, were developed from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to simulate the subarachnoid pressures. These pressures were input to an idealised model of the perivascular space to evaluate potential differences in perivascular flow. Peak pressures in Chiari patients without a syrinx were higher than in controls (46\% increase; p\,=\,.029) and arrived earlier in the cardiac cycle than both controls (2.58\% earlier; p\,=\,.045) and syrinx patients (2.85\% earlier; p\,=\,.045). The perivascular model predicted Chiari patients without a syrinx would have the greatest flow into the cord (p\,{$<$}\,.05) if the arterial pulse delay was between 4 and 10\% of the cardiac cycle. Using phase-contrast MRI the mean arterial delay for all subjects was similar, and was estimated as 4.7\,{$\pm$}\,0.2\%. The perivascular pumping rate showed a strong positive correlation (RAdj2=0.85; p\,{$<$}\,.0001) with extended periods of high pressure that arrived earlier in the cardiac cycle, suggesting these pressure characteristics may play a role in syrinx development.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cervical neuromas with extradural components (intraextradural or strictly extradural forms) are rare. Their resection raises the problems of nerve root preservation, vertebral artery (VA) control, and spinal stability. METHODS: A series of 57 patients with neuromas (29 neurofibromas, 23 schwannomas, 4 neurofibrosarcomas, and 1 plexiform neurofibroma) was treated during the period of 1980 to 1995, using one of the lateral approaches (antero- or posterolateral approach). The VA was always controlled before resection of the tumor. In cases of intraextradural forms, the intradural component was removed by a complementary laminectomy (three patients) in the early period and then by an oblique corpectomy through the same lateral approach (five patients) in the late period. A laminectomy had been performed in 15 other patients (11 patients with intraextradural neuromas) before they were referred to us. These patients included seven with recurrent neuromas, occurring after an average period of 4.1 years (1-9 yr). RESULTS: Complete resection was achieved in all except two patients, in whom the nerve root reacted positively to intraoperative stimulation and could not be separated from the tumor. One of the patients was subsequently operated on after 2 years. Another recurrence was observed in another patient at 1 year. The four patients with sarcomas died from recurrence within 2 years. The rate of root preservation included an average of 28\%, including 43.5\% for schwannomas, 18\% for neurofibromas, 44\% for lower cervical neuromas (C4-C8), and 4.5\% for upper cervical neuromas (C1-C3). Worsening of preoperative neurological deficits was observed in only two patients. The VA was always preserved, except in one patient with a sarcoma that was preoperatively occluded. No instability was observed in any of the patients. CONCLUSION: Complete resection with good neurological results can be achieved in most patients harboring cervical neuromas each with an extradural component by using a lateral approach and VA control. If the root cannot be separated from the tumor, especially in patients with neurofibromas, intraoperative stimulation can help decide whether the root may be divided without incurring postoperative deficit. The lateral approach permits the resection of the extradural as well as the intradural component by a complementary oblique corpectomy. There was no morbidity in relation to VA control as well as no postoperative instability.},

  abstract = {The fluid that resides within cranial and spinal cavities, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), moves in a pulsatile fashion to and from the cranial cavity. This motion can be measured hy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and may he of clinical importance in the diagnosis of several brain and spinal cord disorders such as hydrocephalus, Chiari malformation, and syringomyelia. In the present work, a geometric and hydrodynamic characterization of an anatomically relevant spinal canal model is presented. We found that inertial effects dominate the flow field under normal physiological flow rates. Along the length of the spinal canal, hydraulic diameter was found to vary significantly from 5 to 15 mm. The instantaneous Reynolds number at peak flow rate ranged from 150 to 450, and the Womersle number ranged from 5 to 17. Pulsatile flow calculations are presented for an idealized geometric representation of the spinal cavity. A linearized Navier-Stokes model of the pulsatile CSF flow was constructed based on MRI flow rate measurements taken on a healthy volunteer. The numerical model was employed to investigate effects of cross-sectional geometry and spinal cord motion on unsteady velocity, shear stress, and pressure gradientfields. The velocity field was shown to be blunt, due to the inertial character of the flow, with velocity peaks located near the boundaries of the spinal canal rather than at the midpoint between boundaries. The pressure gradient waveform was found to be almost exclusively dependent on the flow waveform and cross-sectional area. Characterization of the CSF dynamics in normal and diseased states may be important in understanding the pathophysiology of CSF related disorders. Flow models coupled with MRI flow measurements mnay become a noninvasive tool to explain the abnormal dynamics of CSF in related brain disorders as well as to determine concentration and local distribution of drugs delivered into the CSF space.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The management of incidental small unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) is controversial and many factors need to be considered in the decision-making process. The authors describe a large consecutive series of patients harboring small incidental intracranial aneurysms. Treatment strategy, natural history, complications, and short-term outcomes are presented. METHODS: Between January 2008 and May 2011, the authors prospectively evaluated 212 patients with 272 small ({$<$} 10-mm) incidental aneurysms. Treatment recommendations (observation, endovascular treatment, or surgery), complications of treatment, and short-term outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Recommended treatment consisted of observation in 125 patients, endovascular embolization in 64, and surgery in 18. Six patients were excluded from further analysis because they underwent treatment elsewhere. In the observation group, at a mean follow-up of 16.7 months, only 1 patient was moved to the embolization group. Seven (6\%) of the 125 patients in the observation group died of causes unrelated to aneurysm. Sixty-five patients underwent 69 embolization procedures. The periprocedural permanent morbidity and mortality rates in patients undergoing endovascular treatment were 1.5\% and 1.5\%, respectively (overall morbidity and mortality rate 3.0\%). In the surgery group no periprocedural complications were observed, although 1 patient did not return to her previous occupation. No aneurysmal rupture was documented in any of the 3 treatment groups during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: A cautious and individualized approach to incidental UIAs is of utmost importance for formulation of a safe and effective treatment algorithm. Invasive treatment (either endovascular or surgery) can be considered in selected younger patients, certain "higher-risk" locations, expanding aneurysms, patients with a family history of aneurysmal hemorrhage, and in those who cannot live their lives knowing that they harbor the UIA. Although the complication rate of invasive treatment is very low, it is not negligible. The study confirms that small incidental UIAs deemed to be not in need of treatment have a very benign short-term natural history, which makes observation a reasonable approach in selected patients.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Chronic back pain (CBP) may be caused by a variety of conditions including dysfunctional muscles, ligaments or intervertebral discs, improper movement of vertebral column joints, or nerve root compression. Recently, CBP was treated successfully in a patient having an entrapment of cutaneous branches of the posterior rami of the thoracic nerves, termed posterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (POCNES). Our aim is to describe clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and management of patients with such a neuropathic pain syndrome. METHODS: This study analyzed prospectively obtained data from consecutive patients suspected of having POCNES, presenting to two Dutch hospitals between January 2013 and September 2016. Patients received a diagnostic 2-5 mL 1\% lidocaine injection just below the thoracolumbar fascia. Pain was scored using a numerical rating scale (0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain). A {$>$}50\% pain reduction was defined as success. A neurectomy was proposed if pain reduction was temporary or insufficient after one to three injections. Long-term treatment effect was determined using a verbal rating scale (VRS; 1 = very satisfied, no pain, to 5 = pain worse). RESULTS: Fourteen patients (12 women, median age 26, age range 18-73) were diagnosed with POCNES. Eighty-one percent (n=11) reported a {$>$}50\% pain drop after injection (NRS pain scores of median 8.0 [IQR 7.0-8.0] to median 3.0 [IQR 1.5-3.5], P{$<$}0.001). In one patient, repeated injections were successful long-term (VRS score of 2). Two patients declined surgery, whereas the remaining eleven underwent a neurectomy that was successful in seven (64\%). A 57\% long-term efficacy (median 29 months follow-up, range 5-48, VRS score 1-2) was attained in the entire study population. CONCLUSION: POCNES should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic localized back pain. A treatment regimen including injections and neurectomy of the specific cutaneous branch results in long-term pain relief in more than half of these patients.},

  abstract = {The contribution of the trunk muscles to spinal stability is well established. There is convincing evidence for the role of multifidus in spinal stability. Recently, emphasis has shifted to the deep fibres of this muscle (DM) and five key clinical beliefs have arisen: (i) that DM stabilizes the lumbar spine whereas the superficial fibres of lumbar multifidus (SM) and the erector spinae (ES) extend and/or rotate the lumbar spine, (ii) that DM has a greater percentage of type I (slow twitch) muscle fibres than SM and ES, (iii) that DM is tonically active during movements of the trunk and gait, whereas SM and ES are phasically active, (iv) that DM and the transversus abdominis (TrA) co-contract during function, and (v) that changes in the lumbar paraspinal muscles associated with LBP affect DM more than SM or ES. This paper reviews the biomechanical, electromyographic, histochemical and morphological data that underpin these beliefs. Although there is support for the importance of the lumbar multifidus and the specific contribution of this muscle to intervertebral control, several of the clinical beliefs have little or no support and require further evaluation. These findings have implications for clinical practice.},

Subsequent analysis revealed that the principal action of multifidus is posterior sagittal rotation (extension without posterior translation) of the lumbar vertebrae. It has no translatory action. Any axial rotation exerted by the lumbar multifidus is only a minor, secondary action which must be coupled with posterior sagittal rotation. This extension balances the flexion moment generated by the abdominal muscles which rotate the trunk. The constancy of the sites of attachment of the multifidus allows each of its fascicles to be plotted accurately on radiographs or computer diagrams which can be used to produce highly detailed analyses or models of the forces exerted by the multifidus on the lumbar spine.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Asymmetrical degeneration of the disc is one of the most common causes of primary degenerative scoliosis in adults. Coronal deformity is usually less symptomatic than a sagittal deformity because there is less expenditure of energy and hence less effort to maintain upright posture. However, nerve root compression at the fractional curve or at the concave side of the main curve can give rise to debilitating radiculopathy. METHODS This study was a retrospective analysis of 16 patients with coronal deformity of between 10\textdegree{} and 20\textdegree. All patients underwent endoscopic foraminal decompression surgery. The pre- and postoperative Cobb angle, visual analog scale (VAS), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and Oswestry Disability Index scores were measured. RESULTS The average age of the patients was 70.0 {$\pm$} 15.5 years (mean {$\pm$} SD, range 61-86 years), with a mean followup of 7.5 {$\pm$} 5.3 months (range 2-14 months). The average coronal deformity was 16.8\textdegree{} {$\pm$} 4.7\textdegree{} (range 10\textdegree -41\textdegree ). In 8 patients the symptomatic foraminal stenosis was at the level of the fractional curve, and in the remaining patients it was at the concave side of the main curve. One of the patients included in the current cohort had to undergo a repeat operation within 1 week for another disc herniation at the adjacent level. One patient had CSF leakage, which was repaired intraoperatively, and no further complications were noted. On average, preoperative VAS and SF-36 scores showed a tendency for improvement, whereas a dramatic reduction of VAS, by 65\% (p = 0.003), was observed in radicular leg pain. CONCLUSIONS Patients with mild to moderate spinal deformity are often compensated and have tolerable levels of back pain. However, unilateral radicular pain resulting from foraminal stenosis can be debilitating. In select cases, an endoscopic discectomy or foraminotomy enables the surgeon to decompress the symptomatic foramen with preservation of essential biomechanical structures, delaying the need for a major deformity correction surgery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks can be an intractable cause of orthostatic headaches but have several treatable causes. CSF-venous fistulas are an increasingly recognized cause of rapid CSF leaks. Although CSF-venous fistulas have been previously reported in the literature, their imaging appearance, associated anomalies, and treatment are incompletely understood. We present a case of a CSF-venous fistula draining to adjacent venous malformations with symptoms responding to surgical treatment. This is the first such case to our knowledge showing enhancement of venous malformations on computed tomography myelography. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 61-year-old woman with known soft tissue venous malformations presented with progressive hearing loss, headaches, and nausea. Brain magnetic resonance imaging performed at an outside institution showed findings of CSF hypotension. Her symptoms were refractory to a single-level blood patch. Digital subtraction and computed tomography myelography performed at our institution showed CSF-venous fistulas arising from thoracic nerve root sleeve diverticula and draining to paraspinal venous malformations. She was treated with surgical ligation of the fistula and associated nerve roots. At 3-month follow-up, she reported improvement in her headaches, and magnetic resonance imaging showed resolution of all brain abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: CSF-venous fistulas are a relatively uncommon cause of spontaneous CSF leaks. Though difficult to diagnose, they can respond to surgical treatment as seen in this case. In our experience, decubitus digital subtraction myelography combined with computed tomography myelography is instrumental in making the diagnosis and fully characterizing any abnormalities associated with the fistula. This case also supports the suggested association between CSF-venous fistulas and venous malformations, which is worthy of continued study.},

The block pressure was the main mechanical factor in the central part of the spinal canal causing pain and paresis. Elevated fluid pressure caudal to the block was an additional but usually subordinate factor. In 33\% of the patients, normal pressure on the cauda equina was found, and lateral compression of multiple nerve roots seemed to be the only mechanical symptom-causing factor. Clinically, these patients could not be distinguished from patients with central compression. After laminectomy with decompression of the cauda equina, the field should be inspected for lateral narrowing which, if present, should be treated.},

These benefits include metabolic shifts in energy production, the optimisation of peripheral circadian clocks, and overall improvement in physiological markers of metabolic health. IF has been proposed to reduce systemic inflammation and have a role in the prevention and treatment of chronic disease. For the athlete, IF protocols offer a potential new frontier for maintaining performance in the fasted state. They may allow athletes to optimise training adaptions, while respecting individual cultural, religious, and/or spiritual preferences to fast and exercise. Below, we discuss the physiological impact of fasted exercise while highlighting areas for future work to improve our understanding and implementation of the practice for the benefit of both the active general community and sporting populations.},

In a retrospective study, to assess the value of this fixation, 9 patients treated with the AO Internal Fixator and 18 with Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation were reviewed. Mean age at surgery was 60 years (range, 40-88), and curves were measured between 22 degrees and 82 degrees. At follow-up (mean of 56 months for the AO Internal Fixator and 42 months for Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation), the average curve correction was better than 50\% Overall satisfactory clinical results with pain relief and improved walking distance were noted in 86\% of the patients. Using this technique no postoperative deaths or neurologic deficits occurred. Only a few complications and a 4\% pseudarthrosis rate could be observed. Our study shows that the age of the patients with degenerative scoliosis is not a contraindication for major surgery. Meticulous posterior spine release before instrumentation is essential for curve correction and bone fusion. Lumbar lordosis is more easily restored with Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation, which seems to correspond to the incidence of low back pain. Cases with evident neurologic deficits are best treated by additional nerve decompression.},

  abstract = {Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a disorder characterised by raised intracranial pressure that predominantly affects young, obese women. Pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, but several causal factors have been proposed. Symptoms can include headaches, visual loss, pulsatile tinnitus, and back and neck pain, but the clinical presentation is highly variable. Although few studies have been done to support evidence-based management, several recent advances have the potential to enhance understanding of the causes of the disease and to guide treatment decisions. Investigators of the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT) reported beneficial effects of acetazolamide in patients with mild visual loss. Studies have also established weight loss as an effective disease-modifying treatment, and further clinical trials to investigate new treatments are underway. The incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is expected to increase as rates of obesity increase; efforts to reduce diagnostic delays and identify new, effective approaches to treatment will be key to meeting the needs of a growing number of patients.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of population-based hospital discharge registry from all nonfederal acute care hospitals in Washington State. OBJECTIVE: We examined the cumulative incidence of second lumbar spine operation following an initial lumbar operation for degenerative conditions. We aimed to determine if the cumulative incidence of a second lumbar spine operation decreased in the 1990s following an increase in the rate of fusion surgery and the introduction of several newer fusion technologies. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Repeat lumbar spine operations are generally undesirable, implying persistent symptoms, progression of degenerative changes, or treatment complications. Improved technology is expected to improve alignment, healing, and instability, and to reduce repeat operations. METHODS: Among the patients who had an inpatient lumbar decompression or lumbar fusion surgery for degenerative spine disorders in 1990 to 1993 (n = 24,882) or in 1997 to 2000 (n = 25,209), we examined rates of subsequent lumbar spine surgery during a 4-year follow-up. We performed a Cox proportional hazards regression to compare the probability of a reoperation between the 2 cohorts, adjusting for age, sex, primary diagnosis, type of insurance, and comorbidity. RESULTS: Among patients who underwent surgery for lumbar degenerative disease, more than twice as many had a fusion procedure in the 1997 to 2000 cohort (19.1\%) compared with the 1990 to 1993 cohort (9.4\%). However, the 4-year cumulative incidence of reoperation was higher in the 1997 to 2000 cohort compared with the 1990 to 1993 cohort (14.0\% vs. 12.4\%; hazard ratio, 1.16; 95\% confidence interval, 1.11-1.22, P {$<$} 0.001). Among fusion patients, those in the 1997 to 2000 cohort were approximately 40\% more likely to undergo a reoperation within the first year when compared with fusion patients in the 1990 to 1993 cohort. There was no difference in reoperation probability beyond 1 year. CONCLUSION: A higher proportion of fusion procedures and the introduction of new spinal implants between 1993 and 1997 did not reduce reoperation rates. Patients who had lumbar surgery for degenerative disease in the late 1990s were more likely to undergo a repeat operation within 4 years than patients who had surgery in the early 1990s.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This retrospective study analyzes long-term outcomes (15~years) of circumferential lumbar fusion (CF) for degenerative spine disease using instrumented PLIF. The occurrence of adjacent segment degeneration (ASD) and the reintervention rate was specially focused. METHODS: A series of 73 patients who underwent CF (1-3 levels) was reviewed. Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 2, 5, 10 and 15~years after surgery with static and dynamic radiographic studies, CT scan and MRI. Patients completed also the Oswestry-Disability index (ODI), the VAS score, and the patient self-satisfaction questionnaire. RESULTS: At 2-year follow-up, there was a decrease in the average ODI score (from 72.3~{$\pm~$}16.4 preop to 30.5~{$\pm~$}6.2). At 10- and 15-year follow-up, ODI scores return to preoperative scores in patients without revision surgery. The 82.8~\% of patients referred an excellentgood self-satisfaction rate at this time. At 5-year follow-up, seven patients (9.6~\%) required reoperation because of symptomatic ASD. At 10-year follow-up, reoperated patients increased to 24.6~\% (18 cases). Excellent and good self-satisfaction rate decreased to 41.1~\% at this time. Radiological ASD was then detected in 37 cases (50.7~\%). At 15-year follow-up, nine patients were lost and a total of 24 (37.5~\%) required a new surgical treatment because of ASD. The occurrence of revision surgery because of symptomatic ASD was highly dependent of the age of patients at the first surgery and the number of fused levels. CONCLUSION: Circumferential lumbar fusion provides good clinical results at short-term follow-up. From 2- to 15-year follow-up, outcome worsened significantly. The high rate of ASD occurrence and reintervention questions the reliability of this technique for lumbar fusion.},

The aim of our study was analyse the data of recently treated patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms with the special focus on size and configuration in view of the frequency scale in a daily routine setting. METHODS: We reviewed the data of all patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) during the last 24 months at our institution. Configuration and size of the aneurysms were measured. Clinical data were collected using the following classifications for analysis: Hunt and Hess (H\&H), modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Fisher classification. RESULTS: Data of 135 patients with aneurysmal SAH (98 women, 37 men; ratio 2.6:1) were analysed. Analysis showed that 19 aneurysms (14 \%) were {$>$}10 mm (mean size, 19.2 mm) and 116 aneurysms (85.9 \%) {$<$}10 mm (mean size, 6.2 mm). In total, 112 were categorised as berry-like configured aneurysms (n = 113 {$<$}10 mm, n = 3 {$>$}10 mm), 18 as multi-lobar (n = 16 {$<$}10 mm, n = 2 {$>$}10 mm) and 5 as fusiform (n = 4 {$<$}10 mm, n = 1, {$>$}10 mm). CONCLUSION: Since the results of our study showed that the majority of the aneurysms are {$<$}10 mm (mean, 6.2 mm), it is justified to challenge the recommendations of the international guidelines in a daily routine setting. We believe that the published data are not convincing enough to play a guidance role in daily routine. Due to improving surgical and endovascular techniques with satisfying results and the high number of ruptured small aneurysms, we believe a change in attitude in management of small-sized aneurysms is needed. Further diagnostic models are needed to determine the risk of rupture of intracranial aneurysms properly to obtain adequate treatment for UIAs.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of radiological parameters for surgical decision-making in patients with degenerative lumbar scoliosis (DLS) by comparing the clinical and radiological results after decompression or decompression and fusion surgery. METHODS The authors prospectively planned surgical treatment for 298 patients with degenerative lumbar disease between September 2005 and March 2013. The surgical method used at their institution to address intervertebral instability is precisely defined based on radiological parameters. Among 64 patients with a Cobb angle ranging from 10\textdegree{} to 25\textdegree, 57 patients who underwent follow-up for more than 2 years postoperatively were evaluated. These patients were divided into 2 groups: those in the decompression group underwent decompression alone (n = 25), and those in the fusion group underwent decompression and short segmental fusion (n = 32). Surgical outcomes were reviewed, including preoperative and postoperative Cobb angles, lumbar lordosis based on radiological parameters, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores. RESULTS The JOA scores of the decompression group and fusion group improved from 5.9 {$\pm$} 1.6 to 10.0 {$\pm$} 2.8 and from 7.2 {$\pm$} 2.0 to 11.3 {$\pm$} 2.8, respectively, which was not significantly different between the groups. At the final follow-up, the postoperative Cobb angle in the decompression group changed from 14\textdegree{} {$\pm$} 2.9\textdegree{} to 14.3\textdegree{} {$\pm$} 6.4\textdegree{} and remained stable, while the Cobb angle in the fusion group decreased from 14.8\textdegree{} {$\pm$} 4.0\textdegree{} to 10.0\textdegree{} {$\pm$} 8.5\textdegree{} after surgery. CONCLUSIONS The patients in both groups demonstrated improved JOA scores and preserved Cobb angles after surgery. The improvement in JOA scores and preservation of Cobb angles in both groups show that the evaluation of spinal instability using radiological parameters is appropriate for surgical decision-making.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The authors compared the clinical outcomes of microscopic bilateral decompression via a unilateral approach (MBDU) for the treatment of degenerative lumbar scoliosis (DLS) and for lumbar canal stenosis (LCS) without instability. The authors also compared postoperative spinal instability in terms of different approach sides (concave or convex) following the procedure. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed data obtained in 50 consecutive patients (25 in the DLS group and 25 in the LCS group) who underwent MBDU; the minimum follow-up period was 2 years. Patients with DLS were divided into 2 subgroups according to the surgical approach side: a concave group (23 segment) and a convex group (17 segments). The Japanese Orthopaedic Association Scale scores for the assessment of low-back pain were evaluated before surgery and at final follow-up. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association Scale scores and recovery rates were compared between the DLS and LCS groups, and between the convex and concave groups. Cobb angle and scoliotic wedging angle (SWA) were evaluated on standing radiographs before surgery and at final follow-up. Facet joint preservation (the percentage of preservation) was assessed on pre- and postoperative CT scans, compared between the LCS and DLS groups, and compared between the concave and convex groups. The influence of approach side on postoperative progression of segmental instability was also examined in the DLS group. RESULTS: The mean recovery rate was 58.7\% in the DLS and 62.0\% in the LCS group. The mean recovery rate was 58.6\% in the convex group and 60.6\% in the concave group. There were no significant differences in recovery rates between the LCS and DLS groups, or between the DLS subgroups. The mean Cobb angles in the DLS group were significantly increased from 12.7\textdegree{} preoperatively to 14.1\textdegree{} postoperatively (p {$<$} 0.05), and mean preoperative SWAs increased significantly from 6.2\textdegree{} at L3-4 and 4.1\textdegree{} at L4-5 preoperatively to 7.4\textdegree{} and 4.9\textdegree, respectively, at final follow-up (p {$<$} 0.05). There was no significant difference in percentage of preservation between the DLS and LCS groups. The mean percentages of preservation on the approach side in the DLS group at L3-4 and L4-5 were 89.0\% and 83.1\% in the convex group, and those in the concave group were 67.3\% and 77.6\%, respectively. The percentage of preservation at L3-4 was significantly higher in the convex than the concave group. The mean SWA had increased in the concave group (p = 0.01) but not the convex group (p = 0.15) at final follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The MBDU can reduce postoperative segmental spinal instability and achieve good postoperative clinical outcomes in patients with DLS. The convex approach provides surgeons with good visibility and improves preservation of facet joints.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The causal treatment of Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) consists of removing the obstruction of CSF flow at the level of the foramen magnum. Cerebrospinal fluid flow can be visualized using dynamic phase-contrast MR imaging. Because there is only a paucity of studies evaluating CSF dynamics in the region of the spinal canal on the basis of preoperative and postoperative measurements, the authors investigated the clinical usefulness of cardiacgated phase-contrast MR imaging in patients with CM-I. METHODS: Ninety patients with CM-I underwent preoperative MR imaging of CSF pulsation. Syringomyelia was present in 59 patients and absent in 31 patients. Phase-contrast MR imaging of the entire CNS was used to investigate 22 patients with CM-I before surgery and after a mean postoperative period of 12 months (median 12 months, range 3-33 months). In addition to the dynamic studies, absolute flow velocities, the extension of the syrinx, and tonsillar descent were also measured. RESULTS: The changes in pulsation were highly significant in the region of the (enlarged) cistern (p = 0.0005). Maximum and minimum velocities (the pulsation amplitude) increased considerably in the region where the syrinx was largest in diameter. The changes of pulsation in these patients were significant in the subarachnoid space in all spinal segments but not in the syrinx itself and in the central canal. CONCLUSIONS: The demonstration of CSF flow pulsation can contribute to assessments of surgical outcomes. The results presented here, however, raise doubts about current theories on the pathogenesis of syringomyelia.},

  abstract = {As with many pathologies, the course of our understanding of the Chiari I malformation (CIM) has developed extensively over time. The early descriptions of the Chiari malformations by Hans Chiari in 1891 opened the door for future classification and research on this topic. However, even over a long timeframe, our understanding of the pathophysiology and, more importantly, treatment, remained in its infancy. As recently as the 1970s, CIM was not discussed in popular neurology textbooks. Syringomyelia is listed as a degenerative disorder with no satisfactory treatment. Radiation therapy was considered an option in treatment, and surgery was thought to play no role. During the last 40 years, equivalent to the duration of a neurosurgical career, our understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of CIM, coupled with modern MRI, has improved the treatment paradigm for this patient population. More importantly, it has given us evidence confirming that CIM is a disorder responsive to surgical intervention, giving patients once thought to be destined for lifelong disability a comparatively normal life after treatment. The purpose of this article is to offer a review of CIM and its important associated entities. The authors will discuss the evolution in understanding of the Chiari malformation and, importantly, distinguish between symptomatic CIM and asymptomatic tonsillar ectopia, based on imaging and presenting symptomatology. They will discuss techniques for surgical intervention, expected outcomes, and complications after surgery. Proper patient selection for surgery based on appropriate symptomatology is tantamount to achieving good surgical outcomes in this population, separating those who can be helped by surgery from those who are unlikely to improve. While our knowledge of the Chiari malformations continues to improve through the efforts of clinical and basic science researchers, surgeons, and patients, our current understanding of these entities represents a monumental improvement in patient care over a relatively short time period.},

Gross total resection was achieved in 11 patients. Radical subtotal removal was performed in the remaining patient, who had a malignant osteogenic sarcoma. Concomitant spinal stabilization with internal fixation and anterior interbody strut grafting was performed on two patients. No significant perioperative complications occurred. Ten patients were alive and clinically stable at follow-up visits ranging from 14 to 55 months. Two patients died from systemic tumor dissemination during the follow-up period. The lateral extracavitary approach is useful when extensive or difficult spinal and paraspinal exposure is required.

  abstract = {OBJECT: Chiari Type I malformation (CMI) is a congenital disorder recognized by caudal displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum and into the cervical canal. Frequently, associated findings include abnormalities of nearby bony and neural elements as well as syringomyelia. Cerebellar tonsillar ectopia is generally considered pathological when greater than 5 mm below the foramen magnum. However, asymptomatic tonsillar ectopia is an increasingly recognized phenomenon, the significance of which is poorly understood. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of all brain magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained at our hospital over a 43-month period in an attempt to ascertain the relative prevalence and MR imaging characteristics of asymptomatic CMIs. Of 22,591 patients who underwent MR imaging of the head and cervical spine, 175 were found to have CMIs with tonsillar herniation extending more than 5 mm below the foramen magnum. Of these, 25 (14\%) were found to be clinically asymptomatic. The average extent of ectopia in this population was 11.4 +/- 4.86 mm, and was significantly associated with a smaller cisterna magna. Syringomyelia and osseous anomalies were found in only one asymptomatic patient. CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest that the isolated finding of tonsillar herniation is of limited prognostic utility and must be considered in the context of all available clinical and radiographic data. Strategies for treating patients with asymptomatic CMIs are discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage accounts for 20\% of all stroke-related sudden neurological deficits, has the highest morbidity and mortality of all stroke, and the role of surgery remains controversial. We undertook a prospective randomised trial to compare early surgery with initial conservative treatment for patients with intracerebral haemorrhage. METHODS: A parallel-group trial design was used. Early surgery combined haematoma evacuation (within 24 h of randomisation) with medical treatment. Initial conservative treatment used medical treatment, although later evacuation was allowed if necessary. We used the eight-point Glasgow outcome scale obtained by postal questionnaires sent directly to patients at 6 months follow-up as the primary outcome measure. We divided the patients into good and poor prognosis groups on the basis of their clinical status at randomisation. For the good prognosis group, a favourable outcome was defined as good recovery or moderate disability on the Glasgow outcome scale. For the poor prognosis group, a favourable outcome also included the upper level of severe disability. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: 1033 patients from 83 centres in 27 countries were randomised to early surgery (503) or initial conservative treatment (530). At 6 months, 51 patients were lost to follow-up, and 17 were alive with unknown status. Of 468 patients randomised to early surgery, 122 (26\%) had a favourable outcome compared with 118 (24\%) of 496 randomised to initial conservative treatment (odds ratio 0.89 [95\% CI 0.66-1.19], p=0.414); absolute benefit 2.3\% (-3.2 to 7.7), relative benefit 10\% (-13 to 33). INTERPRETATION: Patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage in neurosurgical units show no overall benefit from early surgery when compared with initial conservative treatment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The balance of risk and benefit from early neurosurgical intervention for conscious patients with superficial lobar intracerebral haemorrhage of 10-100 mL and no intraventricular haemorrhage admitted within 48 h of ictus is unclear. We therefore tested the hypothesis that early surgery compared with initial conservative treatment could improve outcome in these patients. METHODS: In this international, parallel-group trial undertaken in 78 centres in 27 countries, we compared early surgical haematoma evacuation within 12 h of randomisation plus medical treatment with initial medical treatment alone (later evacuation was allowed if judged necessary). An automatic telephone and internet-based randomisation service was used to assign patients to surgery and initial conservative treatment in a 1:1 ratio. The trial was not masked. The primary outcome was a prognosis-based dichotomised (favourable or unfavourable) outcome of the 8 point Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) obtained by questionnaires posted to patients at 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN22153967. FINDINGS: 307 of 601 patients were randomly assigned to early surgery and 294 to initial conservative treatment; 298 and 291 were followed up at 6 months, respectively; and 297 and 286 were included in the analysis, respectively. 174 (59\%) of 297 patients in the early surgery group had an unfavourable outcome versus 178 (62\%) of 286 patients in the initial conservative treatment group (absolute difference 3{$\cdot$}7\% [95\% CI -4{$\cdot$}3 to 11{$\cdot$}6], odds ratio 0{$\cdot$}86 [0{$\cdot$}62 to 1{$\cdot$}20]; p=0{$\cdot$}367). INTERPRETATION: The STICH II results confirm that early surgery does not increase the rate of death or disability at 6 months and might have a small but clinically relevant survival advantage for patients with spontaneous superficial intracerebral haemorrhage without intraventricular haemorrhage.

The aneurysm neck originates proximal to the distal dural ring, and the aneurysms typically are larger. Therefore, endovascular techniques are often considered to be the primary treatment option. Treatment techniques and results for 40 clinoidal segment carotid artery aneurysms that were considered unsuitable for contemporary endovascular intervention are analyzed in this report. METHODS: Forty aneurysms in 33 female and 3 male patients were treated surgically. Fifteen patients had bilateral aneurysms; of these patients, four underwent bilateral craniotomies. Twenty-seven aneurysms were 10 to 14 mm in size, eight were 15 to 24 mm, and five were more than 25 mm. The most common presentation was visual loss, which occurred in 13 patients. Seven patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. RESULTS: Thirty-seven aneurysms were directly repaired with clipping, two were trapped with bypass, and one was trapped without bypass. The complication rate was 10\%, with one major stroke, two minor strokes, and one successfully treated brain abscess. CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment of clinoidal segment carotid artery aneurysms can produce acceptable outcomes. Specific preoperative and intraoperative techniques facilitate improved surgical results for aneurysms that are not treatable with contemporary endovascular techniques.},

  abstract = {Hindbrain lesions that distort or compress the cervicomedullary junction are commonly associated with syringomyelia. As a basis for discussing pathogenetic mechanisms, the upper end of the central canal of the spinal cord was examined histologically in six aborted fetuses and 14 adults dying of natural causes; the results were correlated with magnetic resonance images in 40 normal subjects. The central canal of the medulla, which extends from the cervicomedullary junction to the fourth ventricle, was found to migrate dorsally, elongate in dorsoventral diameter, and dilate beneath the tip of the obex to form a large, everted aperture. This opening communicates directly with the subarachnoid space through the foramen of Magendie and is indirectly continuous with the main body of the fourth ventricle. In adults, the aperture of the central canal is located approximately 1.0 cm below the tela choroidea inferior and 3.5 cm below the midpoint of the fourth ventricle. Analysis of magnetic resonance imaging scans in 45 patients with syringomyelia and simple hindbrain lesions revealed two patterns of cavity formation: 1) lesions that obstructed the upper end of the central canal or its continuity with the subarachnoid space produced a noncommunicating type of syringomyelia; and 2) lesions that obstructed the basilar cisterns or the foraminal outlets of the fourth ventricle produced a communicating type of syringomyelia (hydromyelia) in association with hydrocephalus. Evidence is presented that syrinxes occurring with hindbrain lesions are not caused by a caudal flow of cerebrospinal fluid from the fourth ventricle into the central canal of the spinal cord.},

  abstract = {The central canal of the spinal cord is generally regarded as a vestigial structure that is obliterated after birth in 70\% to 80\% of the general population. This report describes the first detailed histological study of the human central canal in 232 subjects ranging in age from 6 weeks' gestation to 92 years. Whole spinal cords were harvested at autopsy and sectioned serially from the conus medullaris to the upper medulla. Histological findings and morphometric analysis of the cross-sectional luminal area were used to grade stenosis at seven levels of the canal. Varying grades of stenosis were present at one or more levels in none (0\%) of 60 fetuses, one (3\%) of 34 infants, three (18\%) of 17 children, 21 (88\%) of 24 adolescents and young adults, 67 (96\%) of 70 middle-aged adults, and all 27 adults aged 65 years or older (100\%). The stenotic process was most pronounced in the thoracic segments of the canal and involved more levels with higher grades of stenosis in older individuals. Histological findings consisted of disorganization of the ependymal epithelium, formation of ependymal rosettes or microcanals, proliferation of subependymal gliovascular buds, and intracanalicular gliosis. These features are consistent with a pathological lesion involving ependymal injury and scarring and are less compatible with an involutional or degenerative process. Stenosis of the central canal probably influences the anatomical features of syringomyelia and may account for variations in cavity formation such as the prevalence of holocord syrinxes in children, the formation of focal and paracentral syrinxes in adults, and the rare incidence of syrinx formation in many older individuals with acquired lesions known to produce syringomyelia.},

  abstract = {This report summarizes neuropathological, clinical, and general autopsy findings in 105 individuals with nonneoplastic syringomyelia. On the basis of detailed histological findings, three types of cavities were distinguished: 1) dilations of the central canal that communicated directly with the fourth ventricle (47 cases); 2) noncommunicating (isolated) dilations of the central canal that arose below a syrinx-free segment of spinal cord (23 cases); and 3) extracanalicular syrinxes that originated in the spinal cord parenchyma and did not communicate with the central canal (35 cases). The incidence of communicating syrinxes in this study reflects an autopsy bias of morbid conditions such as severe birth defects. Communicating central canal syrinxes were found in association with hydrocephalus. The cavities were lined wholly or partially by ependyma and their overall length was influenced by age-related stenosis of the central canal. Non-communicating central canal syrinxes arose at a variable distance below the fourth ventricle and were associated with disorders that presumably affect cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in the spinal subarachnoid space, such as the Chiari I malformation, basilar impression, and arachnoiditis. These cavities were usually defined rostrally and caudally by stenosis of the central canal and were much more likely than communicating syrinxes to dissect paracentrally into the parenchymal tissues. The paracentral dissections of the central canal syrinxes occurred preferentially into the posterolateral quadrant of the spinal cord. Extracanalicular (parenchymal) syrinxes were found typically in the watershed area of the spinal cord and were associated with conditions that injure spinal cord tissue (for example, trauma, infarction, and hemorrhage). A distinguishing feature of this type of cavitation was its frequent association with myelomalacia. Extracanalicular syrinxes and the paracentral dissections of central canal syrinxes were lined by glial or fibroglial tissue, ruptured frequently into the spinal subarachnoid space, and were characterized by the presence of central chromatolysis, neuronophagia, and Wallerian degeneration. Some lesions extended rostrally into the medulla or pons (syringobulbia). Although clinical information was incomplete, simple dilations of the central canal tended to produce nonspecific neurological findings such as spastic paraparesis, whereas deficits associated with extracanalicular syrinxes and the paracentral dissections of central canal syrinxes included segmental signs that were referable to affected nuclei and tracts. It is concluded that syringomyelia has several distinct cavitary patterns with different mechanisms of pathogenesis that probably determine the clinical features of the condition.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Chiari malformations are regarded as a pathological continuum of hindbrain maldevelopments characterized by downward herniation of the cerebellar tonsils. The Chiari I malformation (CMI) is defined as tonsillar herniation of at least 3 to 5 mm below the foramen magnum. Increased detection of CMI has emphasized the need for more information regarding the clinical features of the disorder. METHODS: We examined a prospective cohort of 364 symptomatic patients. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the head and spine, and some were evaluated using CINE-magnetic resonance imaging and other neurodiagnostic tests. For 50 patients and 50 age- and gender-matched control subjects, the volume of the posterior cranial fossa was calculated by the Cavalieri method. The families of 21 patients participated in a study of familial aggregation. RESULTS: There were 275 female and 89 male patients. The age of onset was 24.9+/-15.8 years (mean +/- standard deviation), and 89 patients (24\%) cited trauma as the precipitating event. Common associated problems included syringomyelia (65\%), scoliosis (42\%), and basilar invagination (12\%). Forty-three patients (12\%) reported positive family histories of CMI or syringomyelia. Pedigrees for 21 families showed patterns consistent with autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance. The clinical syndrome of CMI was found to consist of the following: 1) headaches, 2) pseudotumor-like episodes, 3) a Meniere's disease-like syndrome, 4) lower cranial nerve signs, and 5) spinal cord disturbances in the absence of syringomyelia. The most consistent magnetic resonance imaging findings were obliteration of the retrocerebellar cerebrospinal fluid spaces (364 patients), tonsillar herniation of at least 5 mm (332 patients), and varying degrees of cranial base dysplasia. Volumetric calculations for the posterior cranial fossa revealed a significant reduction of total volume (mean, 13.4 ml) and a 40\% reduction of cerebrospinal fluid volume (mean, 10.8 ml), with normal brain volume. CONCLUSION: These data support accumulating evidence that CMI is a disorder of the para-axial mesoderm that is characterized by underdevelopment of the posterior cranial fossa and overcrowding of the normally developed hindbrain. Tonsillar herniation of less than 5 mm does not exclude the diagnosis. Clinical manifestations of CMI seem to be related to cerebrospinal fluid disturbances (which are responsible for headaches, pseudotumor-like episodes, endolymphatic hydrops, syringomyelia, and hydrocephalus) and direct compression of nervous tissue. The demonstration of familial aggregation suggests a genetic component of transmission.},

The coexistence of degenerative stenosis and deformity is a common scenario; Nonetheless, selecting the appropriate surgical intervention requires thorough understanding of the patients clinical symptomatology as well as radiographic parameters. Minimally invasive (MIS) decompression surgery was performed for LSS patients with DLS. The aims of this study were (1) to investigate the clinical outcomes of MIS decompression surgery in LSS patients with DLS, and (2) to identify the predictive factors for both radiographic and clinical outcomes after MIS surgery. 438 consecutive patients were enrolled in this study. Inclusion criteria was evidence of LSS and DLS with coronal curvature measuring greater than 10\textdegree. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, JOA recovery rate, low back pain (LBP), and radiographic features were evaluated preoperatively and at over 2 years postoperatively. Of the 438 patients, 122 were included in final analysis, with a mean follow-up of 2.4 years. The JOA recovery rate was 47.6\%. LBP was significantly improved at final follow-up. Cobb angle was maintained for 2 years postoperatively (p~=~0.159). Clinical outcomes in foraminal stenosis patients were significantly related to sex, preoperative high Cobb angle and progression of scoliosis (p~=~0.008). In the severe scoliosis patients, the JOA recovery was 44\%, and was significantly depended on progression of scoliosis (Cobb angle: preoperation 29.6\textdegree, 2-years follow-up 36.9\textdegree ) and mismatch between the pelvic incidence (PI) and the lumbar lordosis (LL) (preoperative PI-LL 35.5~{$\pm~$}21.2\textdegree ) (p~=~0.028). This study investigated clinical outcomes of MIS decompression surgery in LSS patients with DLS. The predictive risk factors of clinical outcomes were severe scoliosis, foramina stenosis, progressive scoliosis and large mismatch of PI-LL.},

At Barrow Neurological Institute, the authors selectively offer surgical treatment for symptomatic spinal cord CMs. The purpose of this paper is to review the clinical outcomes in patients after resection of these lesions based on a single-center experience over a 25-year period. METHODS: The records of 80 patients who underwent resection of pathologically confirmed spinal cord CMs from January 1985 to May 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. Preoperative clinical status and imaging findings were evaluated as well as immediate and long-term postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: Compared with their preoperative Frankel grade, 11\% of patients were worse, 83\% were the same, and 6\% improved immediately after surgery. At a mean follow-up interval of 5 years, 10\% of patients were worse, 68\% were the same, and 23\% were improved compared with their preoperative status. Five percent of patients underwent reoperation for resection of a symptomatic residual or recurrent lesion. Immediate complications were encountered in 6\% of patients, including CSF leakage and deep venous thrombosis. Long-term complications were encountered in 14\% of patients and included kyphotic deformity, stenosis, and spinal cord tethering. A significant correlation was found between long-term outcome and anteroposterior length of the lesion (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The resection of intramedullary spinal cord CMs can be achieved with good long-term outcomes and an acceptable risk of immediate or delayed complications.},

METHODS: MRI scans showed a dorsal intraspinal extradural cystic lesion at the level from Th11 to L1. Although preoperative cine-MRI scans failed to display the dural defect, an MRI myelography scan showed cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space containing a cyst. RESULTS: The site of shunting between the subarachnoid space and the cyst was visualized as a pulsating flow void to the right of Th12. We removed the cyst wall and closed the dural defect via laminectomy. CONCLUSION: Because the preoperative MRI myelography scan correctly identified the existence and location of the dural defect, we conclude that MRI myelography is helpful for detecting dural defects in patients with epidural arachnoid cysts.},

Lesions in this area also affect recognition of an object after a delay in both humans and monkeys, indicating a role in short-term memory of images. Single-unit recordings from the temporal cortex have shown that some neurons continue to fire when one of two or four colours are to be remembered temporarily. But neuronal responses selective to specific complex objects, including hands and faces, cease soon after the offset of stimulus presentation. These results led to the question of whether any of these neurons could serve the memory of complex objects. We report here a group of shape-selective neurons in an anterior ventral part of the temporal cortex of monkeys that exhibited sustained activity during the delay period of a visual short-term memory task. The activity was highly selective for the pictorial information to be memorized and was independent of the physical attributes such as size, orientation, colour or position of the object. These observations show that the delay activity represents the short-term memory of the categorized percept of a picture.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The cisternal segments of the lower cranial nerves (CNs) adjacent to the jugular foramen (JF) are difficult to identify reliably by routine MR imaging. We performed a 3D balanced fast-field echo imaging technique (3D-bFFE) to obtain detailed anatomy of the cisternal segments of CNs IX, X, and XI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3D-bFFE was used to image the cisternal segments of the lower CNs in 20 healthy volunteers. As an anatomic landmark, CSF recesses adjacent to the JF were divided into 3 parts: the recess for the cochlear aqueduct, the recess for CN IX, and the recess for the CN X/XI complex. MR images were evaluated to identify the cisternal segment of each cranial nerve in relation to these anatomic landmarks. RESULTS: The mean angles of the recess for the cochlear aqueduct for CN IX and CN X/XI to the posterior petrous bone were 41.6 +/- 2.5 degrees , 69.7 +/- 3.1 degrees , and 76.0 +/- 3.4 degrees , respectively (P {$<$} .01). The mean length of the recess for the cochlear aqueduct for CN IX and the CN X/XI complex was 5.91 +/- 0.19, 5.08 +/- 0.11, and 4.76 +/- 0.13 cm, respectively (P {$<$} .01). 3D-bFFE adequately depicted the cisternal segments of CN IX on 38 sides (95\%) and the CN X/XI complex on 39 sides (97.5\%). CONCLUSIONS: The cisternal segments of CN IX, CN X, and CN XI are well identified by using 3D-bFFE, especially by determining the angles of the CSF recesses adjacent to the JF.},

The main outcome of this report was to introduce and characterize brachial multisegmental amyotrophy, a rare, but treatable symptom associated with a spinal CSF leak. METHODS: Between 2013 and 2017, five patients who developed progressive amyotrophy were referred to our hospital. A retrospective and prospective analysis of clinical, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging findings is presented. Data were analyzed between August 2013 and April 2019. RESULTS: Amyotrophy was observed in the C5-C8 myotomes and was more prominent in the proximal muscles than in the distal muscles. Amyotrophy was unilateral in three patients and asymmetric bilateral in two. Electromyography revealed active and chronic denervation in the C5-C8 myotomes, particularly C5-6, of all patients. Although the clinical manifestations of these cases were similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, unusual neuroimaging findings were observed: spinal T2-weighted MRI revealed high-signal-intensity lesions in the bilateral anterior horns at the C2-C4 spinal levels in all five cases; ventral epidural fluid collection was also observed. Thin-cut MRI or digital subtraction myelography showed ventral dural defects associated with CSF leaks at high thoracic levels in four patients; four underwent surgical dural repair, which attenuated or stabilized neurological symptoms, while upper limb weakness worsened in the other patient who did not undergo surgery. CONCLUSIONS: A spinal dural defect may be the essential cause of brachial multisegmental amyotrophy. Surgical dural repair may alter the progressive course of this rare condition.},

OBJECTIVE: To present a rare case of intradural, subpial hemangiopericytoma in the thoracic spine, with a brief overview of the literature. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spinal intradural extramedullary hemangiopericytoma is rare entity that radiographically mimics nerve-sheath tumors. These lesions are typically diagnosed at surgery performed due to suspicion of tumor. METHODS: A 20-year-old man who presented with back pain, leg weakness, and sphincter incontinence. MR imaging demonstrated an intradural extramedullary lesion at the T9-T10 level that was isointense on T1- and T2-weighted images and homogeneously enhancing after administration of gadolinium, with cystic components seen on T2-weighted images. The preoperative diagnosis was meningioma or schwannoma. RESULTS: At surgery, the lesion was bluish and completely subpial, with apparent nerve root invasion. Pathological examination revealed a neoplasm adjacent to a nerve root with possible focal infiltration. Abundant reticulin fibers and widened, branching vascular channels imparting a staghorn appearance were seen. Up to five mitotic figures were counted in one high-power field. On immunostaining, the neoplastic cells were diffusely immunoreactive for CD99 and immunonegative for EMA, CD34, and S-100 protein. The pathological diagnosis was consistent with anaplastic hemangiopericytoma, WHO grade III. CONCLUSION: This is the ninth report of spinal intradural hemangiopericytoma. The location of the neoplasm supports the hypothesis that hemangiopericytoma may arise from the spinal pial capillaries.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The natural history of unruptured intracranial aneurysms remains unclear, and management strategy is not well defined. METHODS: From January 2003 to December 2012, we enrolled patients with aneurysm in our institution. In total, 2252 patients with 2897 aneurysms were eligible for analysis, and 1960 eligible aneurysms were conservatively managed. Precise 3-dimensional evaluation was conducted using computed tomography angiography, digital subtraction angiography, or magnetic resonance angiography. We then assessed the risk of aneurysm rupture, mortality, and morbidity associated with aneurysm characteristics, demographics, and known health/lifestyle risk factors. RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 7388 aneurysm-years. During observation, 56 aneurysms ruptured, resulting in an overall rupture rate per year of 0.76\% (95\% confidence interval, 0.58-0.98). The mean initial visit to rupture interval was 547 days. Aneurysm size, location, daughter sac, and history of subarachnoid hemorrhage were significant independent predictors for aneurysm rupture. Aneurysms that were {$\geq$}5 mm were associated with a significantly increased risk of rupture when compared with 2- to 4-mm aneurysms (unadjusted hazard ratio, 12.24; 95\% confidence interval, 7.15-20.93). Of 56 patients who experienced hemorrhage, 29 (52 \%) died or were rendered severely disabled. Of the patients who had large or giant aneurysms, none recovered without deficits, and the mortality rate after rupture was 69\%. For aneurysms sized {$<$}5 mm, the mortality rate was 18\%. CONCLUSIONS: Larger aneurysms are at greater risk for rupture and poor outcome. Ethnic factors may play a role in the risk of rupture.},

Based on a series of 22 cases, the authors propose a classification comprising three categories: spinal extradural MC's without spinal nerve root fibers (Type I); spinal extradural MC's with spinal nerve root fibers (Type II); and spinal intradural MC's (Type III). Although water-soluble myelography may disclose a filling defect for all three categories, computerized tomographic myelography (CTM) is essential to reveal communication between the cyst and the subarachnoid space. Communication demonstrated by CTM allows accurate diagnosis of a spinal MC and rules out other mass lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging appears useful as an initial study to identify an intraspinal cystic mass. Final characterization is based on operative inspection and histological examination for all three categories.},

Sports-related ASDH is a leading cause of death and severe morbidity in popular contact sports like American football in the USA and judo in Japan. It is thought that rotational acceleration is most likely to produce not only cerebral concussion but also ASDH due to the rupture of a parasagittal bridging vein, depending on the severity of the rotational acceleration injury. Repeated sports head injuries increase the risk for future concussion, cerebral swelling, ASDH or CTE. To avoid fatal consequences or CTE resulting from repeated concussions, an understanding of the criteria for a safe post-concussion return to play (RTP) is essential. Once diagnosed with a concussion, the athlete must not be allowed to RTP the same day and should not resume play before the concussion symptoms have completely resolved. If brain damage has been confirmed or a subdural hematoma is present, the athlete should not be allowed to participate in any contact sports. As much remains unknown regarding the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of sports-related concussion, ASDH, and CTE, basic and clinical studies are necessary to elucidate the crucial issues in sports-related head injuries.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is generally treated by burr-hole irrigation, but it can recur despite repeating these procedures. Embolization of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) has recently been proposed as a curative treatment for CSDH, but evidence for the indication and timing of MMA embolization is not definitive. The present study retrospectively analyzed the effects and safety of MMA embolization among patients with persistent CSDH recurrence. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed data from 381 consecutive patients who underwent burr-hole irrigation for CSDH between 2009 and 2017. Recurrent symptomatic ipsilateral CSDH in 71 (18\%) patients was treated by a second burr-hole irrigation, and 20 of them had a further symptomatic CSDH recurrence thereafter. Those with persistent ipsilateral CSDH recurrence were treated by MMA embolization. Before the MMA embolization procedures, the amount of hematoma membrane enhancement determined using superselective MMA angiography-DynaCT imaging was classified into 3 stages. RESULTS: Embolization of the MMA proceeded without perioperative complications or further CSDH recurrence. The interval between recurrence and the amount of hematoma membrane enhancement significantly correlated (first to second and second to third treatments: P~= 0.012 and P~= 0.017, respectively). The frequency of bilateral CSDH was significantly higher and the recurrence interval between the first and second treatments was significantly shorter in the repeated recurrences group compared with the recurrence group (P~= 0.023 and P~= 0.006, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Repeatedly recurrent CSDH can be safely treated and cured by MMA embolization. Hematoma membrane enhancement pattern using DynaCT images can predict repeated recurrences CSDH.},

After the first operation, a single pedicle was clearly demonstrated by 3D constructive interference in steady state (CISS) MRI. Thus, additional surgery aimed at closing the dural defect was performed to prevent future enlargement of the cyst. The operative findings were consistent with those of 3D CISS imaging. Clinical and radiological features of this lesion are discussed, focusing on the usefulness of 3D CISS MRI for preoperative evaluation, and especially for delineating the pedicle in cases of large extradural spinal arachnoid cysts.},

In treating cervical dumbbell neurinoma, possible difficulties include reoperation due to recurrent tumor, denervation due to nerve root resection, and postoperative spinal deformity due to extensive bony removal. METHODS: We reviewed 75 cases of cervical dumbbell neurinoma that were treated surgically between 1985 and 2006. Postoperative neurological deficits, effects of surgical margins on tumor recurrence, and surgical complications were investigated retrospectively. RESULTS: Sensory and motor deficits due to resection of specific nerve roots appeared temporarily in 33 and 23 \% of all cases, and persisted in 8 and 8 \% at final evaluation, respectively. Total, subtotal, and partial resection was performed in 57, 13, and 5 cases, respectively. The total resection rate was low in the tumors that had large extraforaminal components. Of the subtotally resected 13 cases, only two cases of high tumor-growth rate required re-operation or showed tumor growth. Among the five partially resected cases, re-operation was necessary in two cases 13 and 15 years later because of aggravated neurological symptoms due to tumor growth. Two patients who underwent C2 laminectomy developed kyphosis, and three patients who underwent facet joint resection and curettage of vertebral body lesions developed scoliosis. CONCLUSION: Total resection should be attempted for cervical dumbbell tumors. In cases where total resection was potentially of high risk, however, subtotal resection (within the capsule) was found to be a practical choice yielding favorable long-term outcome when the tumor growth rate (MIB-1 index) was low.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The pathophysiology of occult tethered cord syndrome (OTCS) with no anatomical evidence of a caudally shifted conus and a normal terminal filum is hard to understand. Therefore, the diagnosis of OTCS is often difficult. The authors hypothesized that the posterior displacement of the terminal filum may become prominent in patients with OCTS who are in a prone position if filum inelasticity exists, and they investigated prone-position MRI findings. METHODS: Fourteen patients with OTCS and 12 control individuals were examined using T2-weighted axial MRI with the patients in a prone position on a flat table. On each axial view, the distance between the posterior and anterior ends of the subarachnoid space (A), the distance between the posterior end of the subarachnoid space and the terminal filum (B), the distance between the posterior end of the subarachnoid space and the dorsal-most nerve among the cauda equina (C), and the distance between the posterior end of the subarachnoid space and the ventral-most nerve (D) were measured. The location ratios of the terminal filum, the dorsal-most nerve, and the ventral-most nerve were calculated by the ratio of A to B (defined as TF = B/A), A to C (defined as DN = C/A), and A to D (defined as VN = D/A), respectively. Patients underwent sectioning of the terminal filum with the aid of a surgical microscope. The low-back pain Japanese Orthopaedic Association score was obtained before surgery and at the final follow-up visit. RESULTS: On prone-position axial MRI, the terminal filum was separated from the cauda equina and was shifted caudally to posterior in the subarachnoid space in all patients with OTCS. The locations of the caudal cauda equina shifted to ventral in the subarachnoid space. The TF values in the OTCS group were significantly lower than those in the control group at the L3-4 (p = 0.023), L-4 (p = 0.030), L4-5 (p = 0.002), and L-5 (p {$<$} 0.001) levels. In contrast, the DN values in the OTCS group were significantly higher than those of the control group at the L-2 (p = 0.003), L2-3 (p = 0.002), L-3 (p {$<$} 0.001), L3-4 (p {$<$} 0.001), L-4 (p = 0.007), L4-5 (p = 0.003), and S-1 (p = 0.014) levels, and the VN values in the OTCS group were also significantly higher than those of the control group at the L2-3 (p = 0.022), L-3 (p = 0.027), L3-4 (p = 0.002), L-4 (p = 0.011), L4-5 (p = 0.019), and L5-S1 (p = 0.040) levels. Sections were collected during surgery for histological evaluation, and a decreased elasticity within the terminal filum was suggested. Improvements in the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score were observed at the final follow-up in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' new method of using the prone position for MRI shows that the terminal filum is located significantly posterior and the cauda equina is located anterior in patients with OTCS, suggesting a difference in elasticity between the terminal filum and cauda equina.},

It was diagnosed using cinematic magnetic resonance imaging (cine-MRI). OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the effectiveness of selective closure of the dural defect as a treatment for a spinal extradural arachnoid cyst. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The standard treatment for a spinal extradural arachnoid cyst is total resection of the cyst wall, if possible, and the closure of the communication site, if any, between the cyst and the subarachnoid space, after an extensive laminectomy. To our knowledge, selective closure of the dural defect through minimal laminotomy with little cyst resection has not been reported. METHODS: A 29-year-old woman presented with right leg muscle weakness and was diagnosed with an extradural arachnoid cyst ranging from spinal regions T11 to L3 using MRI. Myelography demonstrated that the cyst communicated with the subarachnoid space. Cine-MRI showed a pulsating flow voiding on the left side of level L1, suggesting the location of the communication site. Fenestration of the T12-L1 region was performed, preserving the spinous processes and the facet joints. A small dural rent was found on the left side of level L1. This was closed using small clips. RESULTS: MRI 12 days later demonstrated that the cyst had shrunk dramatically. It had disappeared completely by 4 months. The patient's muscle weakness improved gradually, and she was almost complaint-free 6 months after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Selective closure of the dural defect based on cine-MRI will be useful for treating extradural arachnoid cysts.},

RECENT FINDINGS: There were 43 tumors in total, including vagal (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}20), sympathetic (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}13), brachial plexus (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}6), cervical plexus (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2), and two with no major neural involvement. Of the 16 vagal tumors that underwent enucleation, 15 had near-normal or normal voices at 1 year. Eight had normal vocal cord function, three had a partially mobile vocal cord with normal voice, and four had an immobile vocal cord with near-normal or normal voices. One patient had an immobile vocal cord requiring medialization laryngoplasty and arytenoid adduction. Of the 13 sympathetic schwannomas, three underwent enucleation. All three of these patients displayed Horner's triad in the early postoperative period; however, each of them significantly improved within the first 6 months. Of the patients with brachial plexus schwannomas, four underwent enucleation with no postoperative deficits in motor function to the arm. SUMMARY: Intracapsular enucleation of cervical schwannomas appears to be an effective long-term oncologic treatment while providing significant improvement in functional outcomes.},

RECENT FINDINGS: There were 43 tumors in total, including vagal (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}20), sympathetic (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}13), brachial plexus (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}6), cervical plexus (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2), and two with no major neural involvement. Of the 16 vagal tumors that underwent enucleation, 15 had near-normal or normal voices at 1 year. Eight had normal vocal cord function, three had a partially mobile vocal cord with normal voice, and four had an immobile vocal cord with near-normal or normal voices. One patient had an immobile vocal cord requiring medialization laryngoplasty and arytenoid adduction. Of the 13 sympathetic schwannomas, three underwent enucleation. All three of these patients displayed Horner's triad in the early postoperative period; however, each of them significantly improved within the first 6 months. Of the patients with brachial plexus schwannomas, four underwent enucleation with no postoperative deficits in motor function to the arm. SUMMARY: Intracapsular enucleation of cervical schwannomas appears to be an effective long-term oncologic treatment while providing significant improvement in functional outcomes.},

A 49-year-old man had dragged his right foot for 4 years. He also complained of a tingling sensation in his right arm and occipitalgia. Neurological examination disclosed right hemiparesis, hypalgesia in the right half of the body and hypertonicity of the lower extremities. MRIs showed a flow void area which compressed and distorted the spinal cord bilaterally at the level of the atlas. A vertebral angiogram showed that the bilateral vertebral arteries had pierced the dura matter under the posterior arch of the atlas, turned upward and laterally in the vertebral canal, making vascular loops at the level of the atlas. 3D CT angiography showed the loops convex medially in the anterior part of the vertebral canal. With these findings, we diagnosed the patient as suffering compression of the cervical cord by the bilateral anomalous vertebral arteries. Suboccipital craniectomy and C1 laminectomy were performed. When the dura mater was opened, the dorsolateral aspect of the spinal cord was found to be compressed and indented markedly by the vertebral arteries. To decompress the spinal cord, the vertebral arteries were retracted dorsolaterally by means of Gore-tex tape and anchored to the spinous process of the axis. Postoperatively, his neurological symptoms improved. Postoperative MRIs showed that the spinal cord was decompressed and had recovered its contour. A review of the literature revealed that only 3 such cases as this one have been reported. The clinical features of these rare cases are nonspecific myelopathy and concomitant occipitalgia or neck pain. The main cause of this rare entity seemed to be the compression of the vertebral artery through its course when it enters the vertebral canal between the atlas and the axis.},

Cervical spines, levels C2-C7, were tested with physiologic loading in a constraint-free test system, the motion of each body being tracked in a three-dimensional coordinate system. Cervical laminectomy with 25\% or more facetectomy resulted in a highly significant increase in cervical motion compared to the intact specimens for the dominant motions of flexion/extension (P {$<$} 0.003), axial torsion (P {$<$} 0.001), and lateral bending (P {$<$} 0.001). Cervical laminaplasty was not significantly different from the intact control, except for a marginal increase in axial torsion. Coupled motion did not change with laminaplasty or laminectomy with progressive facetectomy. As little as 25\% facetectomy adversely affects stability after multilevel cervical laminectomy. Cervical laminaplasty avoids this problem, while still affording multilevel decompression. Therefore in patients undergoing cervical laminectomy accompanied by more than 25\% bilateral facetectomy, concurrent arthrodesis should be performed.},

Preoperative and postoperative spinal canal dimensions are measured to assess the effectiveness of this technique. OBJECTIVES: To develop a simple yet effective technique to stabilize the posterior elements after laminoplasty and to compare preoperative and postoperative spinal canal dimensions to accepted normal values. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Expansive open-door laminoplasty has been offered as a simple alternative to laminectomy, which has been associated with postoperative kyphosis. Although the technique of laminoplasty is effective, a simple and reliable method of holding the posterior elements open has not been described. METHODS: Ten myelopathic patients with multilevel cervical canal stenosis secondary to spondylosis or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament were treated with an expansive open-door laminoplasty. The posterior elements were stabilized in the open position with titanium miniplates. Computer-assisted morphometric analysis was performed on preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans to obtain spinal canal dimensions. Plain radiographs were used to monitor construct integrity. RESULTS: The preoperative sagittal canal diameter was 8.2 +/- 0.96 mm, and the canal area was 180.6 +/- 33.7 mm2. These dimensions increased after surgery to 16.6 +/- 1.5 mm and 321.9 +/- 29.7 mm2, respectively. The titanium miniplate constructs did not fail during the follow-up period (mean, 26.4 months), and the decompression was maintained. The single significant complication was transient C5 radiculopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Normal canal dimensions can be reestablished with open-door laminoplasty. Achieving and maintaining an increased sagittal canal diameter is probably the most important change in anatomic parameters to facilitate neurologic recovery. The use of titanium miniplates to stabilize the posterior elements after laminoplasty is a simple, durable, and effective technique to maintain the increased sagittal diameter of the spinal canal.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Laminectomy and bilateral laminotomy are the standard procedures for decompression of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). With the aim of less invasiveness and better preservation of spinal stability, the technique of unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression (ULBD) was developed. However, limited follow-up data exist to determine the efficiency and outcome of ULBD. Therefore, the authors present their 10-year experience with ULBD and postoperative long-term results. METHODS: One hundred thirty-three consecutive patients (73 men and 60 women; mean age, 63 yr) meeting clinical and radiographic criteria for LSS who underwent first-time ULBD between 1994 and 1999 entered the study. The study parameters were set to ensure a follow-up period of at least 4 years. All patients were available for short-term follow-up re-evaluation within 3 months, and 102 (77\%) of the 133 patients were available for long-term examination after a mean duration of 5.6 years. The scale of Finneson and Cooper was used for evaluation of the clinical results. RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients (97.7\%) improved immediately after surgery. Ninety-four (92.2\%) of the 102 patients available for long-term follow-up examination remained improved, and 85.3\% had an excellent-to-fair operative result. The incidence of complications was 9.8\%. Resurgery for complication was necessary in three patients, for restenosis in seven patients, and for spinal instability in two patients, accounting for a reoperation rate of 11.8\%. CONCLUSION: ULBD allows achievement of good and long-lasting operative results in patients with LSS. Postoperative deterioration, recurrences, and spinal instability are infrequent. For the authors, ULBD is the preferred technique to treat symptomatic LSS.},

MRI demonstrated diffuse hyperintense white matter lesions on T2-weighted imaging. Mild bilateral papilledemas developed in the fundi, when her headache was exacerbated. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was 550 mmH2O. Cerebral angiography showed no cerebral sinus thrombosis. She was diagnosed as BIH secondary to SLE. Since RI cisternography revealed remarkably delayed absorption of the CSF, it was speculated that the CSF absorption by arachnoid villi would be probably disturbed in association with some autoimmune mechanisms by SLE. The subsequent rise of intraventricular pressure may result in retrograde transependymal flow of the CSF and the diffuse hyperintense white matter lesions on MRI.},

Fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated from an FA map, and tractography was investigated. In asymptomatic nerves, tractography showed all L3-S1 spinal nerve roots clearly. Abnormalities of tractography were classified into three types by shape; "Disrupted", "Narrowing", and "Tapering". More abnormalities of tractography were found in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, and especially in patients with foraminal stenosis. The disrupted type was the most common. The mean FA of entrapped symptomatic nerves was less than seen on the intact side. This study demonstrates that tractography shows abnormal findings for nerve roots in lumbar spinal degeneration and that FA decreases in symptomatic roots. DTI may offer not only morphological evaluation, but also quantitative evaluation. We believe that DTI can be used as a tool for the diagnosis of lumbar spinal degenerative disease.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The management of isthmic spondylolisthesis remains controversial, especially with respect to reduction. There have been no reports regarding appropriate slip reduction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the following issues: (1) surgical outcomes of posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with total facetectomy for low-dysplastic isthmic spondylolisthesis, including postoperative complications; (2) effects of slip reduction on surgical outcomes; and (3) appropriate slip reduction. METHODS: A total of 106 patients who underwent PLIF with total facetectomy for low-dysplastic isthmic spondylolisthesis and who were followed for at least 2 years were reviewed. The average follow-up period was 8 years. Surgical outcomes, including the scores assessed using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association scoring system, the recovery rate, and postoperative complications were investigated. As for radiographic evaluations, pre- and postoperative slip and disc height, instrumentation failure, and fusion status were also examined. RESULTS: The pre- and postoperative average Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores were 14 (range 3-25) and 25 (range 11-29) points, respectively. The average recovery rate was 73\% (range 0\%-100\%). The average pre- and postoperative slip was 24\% and 10\%, respectively. A significant correlation between postoperative slip and clinical outcomes was found; clinical outcomes were better in proportion to slip reduction. Although no statistical difference was detected in clinical outcomes between postoperative slip of less than 10\% and from 10\% to 20\%, patients with postoperative slip of more than 20\% showed significantly worse clinical outcomes. Postoperative complications included neurological deficits in 7 patients (transient motor loss in 6 and permanent motor loss in 1), instrumentation failures in 7, adjacent-segment degeneration in 5, and nonunion in 4. Instrumentation failures occurred significantly more often in patients with more slip reduction, although slip reduction did not affect the other postoperative complications. All patients with instrumentation failure showed postoperative slip reduction within 10\%. CONCLUSIONS: The use of PLIF with total facetectomy for low-dysplastic isthmic spondylolisthesis appears to produce satisfactory clinical outcomes, with an average of 73\% recovery rate and few postoperative complications. Although clinical outcomes were better in proportion to slip reduction, excessive reduction caused instrumentation failure, and patients with less reduction demonstrated worse clinical outcomes. Appropriate reduction resulted in a postoperative slip ranging from 10\% to 20\%.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms previously proposed for the progression of syringomyelia associated with Chiari I malformation of the cerebellar tonsils are controversial, leave many clinical observations unexplained, and underlie the prevalence of different operations currently used as initial treatment. To explore the mechanism of syringomyelia progression in this setting, the authors used anatomical and dynamic (phase-contrast and phase-contrast cine) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and intraoperative ultrasonography to examine the anatomy and dynamics of movement of the cerebellar tonsils, the wall of the spinal cord surrounding the syrinx, and the movement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and syrinx fluid at rest, during the respiratory and cardiac cycles, and during Valsalva maneuver in seven affected patients. In all patients the cerebellar tonsils occluded the subarachnoid space at the level of the foramen magnum. Syringomyelia extended from the cervical to the lower thoracic segment of the spinal cord. No patient had evidence of a patent communication between the fourth ventricle and the syrinx on anatomical MR images, dynamic MR images, or intraoperative ultrasound studies. Dynamic MR images of three patients revealed abrupt downward movement of the spinal CSF and the syrinx fluid during systole and upward movement during diastole, but limited movement of CSF across the foramen magnum during the cardiac cycle. Intraoperative ultrasound studies demonstrated abrupt downward movement of the cerebellar tonsils during systole that was synchronous with sudden constriction of the spinal cord and syrinx. Decompression of the foramen magnum was achieved via suboccipital craniectomy, laminectomy of C-1 and C-2, and dural grafting, leaving the arachnoid intact. Immediately after surgery, the pulsatile downward thrust of the tonsils and constriction of the spinal cord and syrinx disappeared. Syringomyelia resolved within 1 to 6 months after surgery in all patients. Observations by the authors suggest the following previously unrecognized mechanism for progression of syringomyelia associated with occlusion of the subarachnoid space at the foramen magnum. The brain expands as it fills with blood during systole, imparting a systolic pressure wave to the intracranial CSF that is accommodated in normal subjects by sudden movement of CSF from the basal cisterns to the upper portion of the spinal canal. With obstruction to rapid movement of CSF at the foramen magnum, the cerebellar tonsils, which plug the subarachnoid space posteriorly, move downward with each systolic pulse, acting as a piston on the partially isolated spinal CSF and producing a systolic pressure wave in the spinal CSF that acts on the surface of the spinal cord.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Without texts I would not have a subject to teach, and the goal of many Latin programs (including my own) is teaching students to read Latin texts. I began my Latin teaching career while teaching the language to myself as well. The goal (both for myself and my students) was to read Latin confidently and fluidly, from left to right, processing the meaning of the words as my eye scanned the pages. Yet my good intentions were soon frustrated, and I was baffled by a problem which I soon realised was not unique to my situation: despite years of training, neither I nor my students could read Latin in a natural, fluid way. Furthermore, textbooks and colleagues seemed resigned to the view that such a goal was unrealistic or unobtainable. Best to treat language as a puzzle to be solved, or linguistic knot to be untangled, rather than a language expressing a message. Only the most intellectually gifted students continued in my `puzzle-solving' course; consequently, my enrolment dropped off steeply after the second year. Looking for more help, I even implemented various `rules for reading' and `reading strategies' advocated by others, yet rather than improve student reading ability, I felt my curriculum begin to feel increasingly cluttered with activities and processes that stole away from my students the valuable time needed to interact with the language itself. It was not until I began investigating the field of Second Language Acquisition (hereafter SLA) that I discovered some simple, yet fundamental principles about language that helped explain my students' struggles and helped me rethink language teaching in general.},

  abstract = {The classic hypothesis presents the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as the "third circulation," which flows from the brain ventricles through the entire CSF system to the cortical subarachnoid space to eventually be passively absorbed into the superior sagittal sinus through arachnoid granulations. The choroid plexus (CP) represents a key organ in the classic CSF physiology and a powerful biological pump, which exclusively secretes CSF. Thereby, the CP is considered to be responsible for CSF pressure regulation and hydrocephalus development. This article thoroughly analyzes the role of the CP in the CSF dynamics, presenting arguments in favor of the thesis that the CPs are neither biological pumps nor the main site of CSF secretion; that they do not participate in regulation of ICP/CSF pressure; are not the reason for the existence of hydrostatic pressure gradient in the CSF system and that this gradient is not permanent (disappeared in the horizontal position); and that they do not generate imagined unidirectional CSF circulation, hydrocephalus development and increased ICP/CSF pressure. The classic hypothesis cannot provide an explanation for these controversies but the recently formulated Bulat-Klarica-Ore\v{s}kovi\'c hypothesis can. According to this hypothesis, CSF production and absorption (CSF exchange) are constant and present everywhere in the CSF system, and although the CSF is partially produced by the CP, it is mainly formed as a consequence of water filtration between the capillaries and interstitial fluid.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: Examine the functional outcomes and complications following laminectomy for thoracic myelopathy due to ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: OLF is a rare condition that can cause thoracic myelopathy. Laminectomy is a procedure that can be performed to decompress the spinal cord in patients with thoracic myelopathy due to OLF. Few studies have examined postoperative outcomes and complications following laminectomy for thoracic myelopathy secondary to OLF. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. Literature search yielded six studies that met our selection criteria. Study characteristics and baseline patient demographics were extracted from each study. Primary outcomes included pre- and postoperative Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scores and perioperative complications including dural tears, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, neurological deficits, surgical site infections, and other complications. We calculated pooled proportion estimates for JOA scores and complications using a random effects model. RESULTS: A total of 137 patients were included. The pooled pre- and postoperative JOA scores were 5.08 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.70-7.47; I{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}98\%) and 8.29 (95\% CI, 7.73-8.85; I{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}18\%), respectively, with a mean improvement of +3.03 points (95\% CI, 1.08-4.98; I{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}88\%). Pooled proportion estimates for dural tears, CSF leaks, infections, and early neurological deficits were 18.4\% (95\% CI, 12.6-26.1; I{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0\%), 12.1\% (95\% CI, 6.6-21.2; I{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0\%), 5.8\% (95\% CI, 2.1-15.4; I{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0\%), and 5.7\% (95\% CI, 2.2-14.3; I{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0\%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Thoracic myelopathy secondary to OLF can be treated with laminectomy. However, despite some improvement in JOA score, functional status remains poor postoperatively. Perioperative complications are common, with dural tears and CSF leaks occurring most frequently. OLF is an uncommon condition and more research is needed to better understand how we can improve the outcomes of laminectomy alone for the treatment of thoracic myelopathy due to OLF.

  abstract = {This study presents the late results of the Gill operation for the treatment of lytic lumbar spondylolisthesis in 75 patients. The observation time ranged for 5 to 20 years, averaging 12 years. Primary results were excellent, good or fair in 83 per cent at the end of 1 year. However, the figures dropped to 75 per cent when the cases were evaluated 5 or more years after operation. The worsening of the results during the observation time seems to depend on the degeneration of the intervertebral disk. Progression of olisthesis was observed in 27 per cent of the patients, usually in connection with progression of disk degeneration. This progression did not affect the clinical result of treatment. Nine patients had a lumbar disk herniation, 8 from a segment above the level of defect and 1 at that level. On 9 patients a fusion was later performed as a secondary operation. In these the late result was still unsatisfactory in all but 2. The operation is contraindicated in adolescents except in exceptional cases with signs of compression of the cauda equina. It is not recommended for patients below the age of 30 years. The main indication for the Gill operation is painful spondylolisthesis with nerve root symptoms in patients over 40 years of age.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Pseudotumor cerebri, or benign intracranial hypertension, is a condition of raised intracranial pressure in the absence of a mass lesion or cerebral edema. It is characterized by headache and visual deterioration that may culminate in blindness. Pseudotumor cerebri is caused by venous sinus obstruction in an unknown percentage of cases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of cerebral venous sinus disease in pseudotumor cerebri and the potential of endoluminal venous sinus stent placement as a new treatment. METHODS: Nine consecutive patients in whom diagnoses of pseudotumor cerebri had been made underwent examination with direct retrograde cerebral venography (DRCV) and manometry to characterize the morphological features and venous pressures in their cerebral venous sinuses. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was measured simultaneously in two patients. If patients had an amenable lesion they were treated using an endoluminal venous sinus stent. Five patients demonstrated morphological obstruction of the venous transverse sinuses (TSs). All lesions were associated with a distinct pressure gradient and raised proximal venous sinus pressures. Four patients underwent stent insertion in the venous sinuses and reported that their headaches improved immediately after the procedure and remained so at 6 months. Vision was improved in three patients, whereas it remained poor in one despite normalized CSF pressures. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with pseudotumor cerebri should be evaluated with DRCV and manometry because venous TS obstruction is probably more common than is currently appreciated. In patients with a lesion of the venous sinuses, treatment with an endoluminal venous sinus stent is a viable alternative for amenable lesions.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The authors analyzed a series of 118 cases of spinal dumbbell tumors to elucidate the feature of the tumors. METHODS: Of 674 cases of spinal cord tumors, the incidence of dumbbell tumors was studied. The tumors were analyzed, and the authors focus on the distribution of age and sex, the pathological diagnoses, their locations, Eden classification, and the surgical methods used. RESULTS: The incidence of dumbbell tumors was 18\%. The mean patient age was 43 years, which was younger than that for all spinal cord tumors (mean 50 years). There were 11 patients younger than 10 years of age. The rate of dumbbell tumors in the cervical spine was significantly higher than that of all spinal cord tumors. Fifteen (18\%) of the 81 schwannomas were observed in the C-2 nerve root, thus having a higher incidence than those in the other nerve roots. In 99 cases (84\%), the tumors were removed through a hemilaminectomy with or without a facetectomy and posterior fusion. Of 118 cases, 69\% of the tumors were schwannomas, and malignant tumors were found in 10 cases (8.5\%). Seven (64\%) of 11 patients younger than 10 years of age had malignant tumors. Three patients older than 10 years of age had malignant tumors, thus accounting for 2.8\% of the 107 older patients. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of dumbbell tumors was 18\%, and they are not uncommon. Malignant dumbbell tumors were more common in children younger than 10 years of age than in older patients.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seven patients who were admitted to our clinic with the diagnosis of Chiari 0 malformation from January 2005 to July 2016 were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent a detailed preoperative neurological examination. Entire neuroaxis MRI and phase-contrast cine MRI were obtained preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: Seven patients (5 female and 2 male) with Chiari type 0 malformation fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All of the patients had absent cine flow at the craniovertebral junction except two patients. These five patients underwent surgical interventions; suboccipital decompression and duraplasty. All of them showed both clinical and radiological improvement in the postoperative period. CONCLUSION: Cine flow MRI appears to be a useful tool in the management of patients with Chiari 0 malformation. There was a good correlation between the clinical presentation and cine flow preoperatively, and between clinical improvement and cine flow in the postoperative period.},

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The development of pathology at the mobile segment next to a lumbar or lumbosacral spinal fusion has been termed adjacent segment disease. Initially reported to occur rarely, it is now considered a potential late complication of spinal fusion that can necessitate further surgical intervention and adversely affect outcomes. METHODS: MEDLINE literature search. RESULTS: The most common abnormal finding at the adjacent segment is disc degeneration. Biomechanical changes consisting of increased intradiscal pressure, increased facet loading, and increased mobility occur after fusion and have been implicated in causing adjacent segment disease. Progressive spinal degeneration with age is also thought to be a major contributor. From a radiographic standpoint, reported incidence during average postoperative follow-up observation ranging from 36 to 369 months varies substantially from 5.2 to 100\%. Incidence of symptomatic adjacent segment disease is lower, however, ranging from 5.2 to 18.5\% during 44.8 to 164 months of follow-up observation. The rate of symptomatic adjacent segment disease is higher in patients with transpedicular instrumentation (12.2-18.5\%) compared with patients fused with other forms of instrumentation or with no instrumentation (5.2-5.6\%). Potential risk factors include instrumentation, fusion length, sagittal malalignment, facet injury, age, and pre-existing degenerative changes. CONCLUSION: Biomechanical alterations likely play a primary role in causing adjacent segment disease. Radiographically apparent, asymptomatic adjacent segment disease is common but does not correlate with functional outcomes. Potentially modifiable risk factors for the development of adjacent segment disease include fusion without instrumentation, protecting the facet joint of the adjacent segment during placement of pedicle screws,fusion length, and sagittal balance.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Thoracic myelopathy secondary to OLF is a rare disease described almost exclusively in Japanese patients. Few series of OLF in South Korean subjects has previously been published. This study is to describe the clinical and radiologic aspects, as well as surgical outcomes in a group of South Korean patients. METHODS: A retrospective study of 8 consecutive patients, including 4 men and 4 women (mean age, 55.6 years), was conducted from 2002 to 2005. Diagnosis in each case was established using CT. Magnetic resonance imaging was also performed in every case. All patients treated surgically and pathologic studies were performed. A comparison between the preoperative neurological status and the status at follow-up was done using Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scoring system. RESULTS: Walking difficulties were the most common presenting complaint. A picture of spastic paraparesis associated with sphincter dysfunction was the most common finding on initial examination. In each case, CT provided sufficient information to establish a diagnosis of OLF, while magnetic resonance imaging was helpful for showing spinal cord involvement. In most of the patients, OLF was located in the lower thoracic spine (T10-T11). Decompressive laminectomy with excision of the OLF resulted in significant improvement in motor weakness and gait in 5 (2 excellent, 3 good) patients who had short duration and no hyperintense intramedullary lesion of spinal cord on MRI. All patients improved in their gait and spasticity, but 2 patients had persistent sensory deficit. CONCLUSION: OLF is a rare cause of thoracic myelopathy. The frequency appears to have been rarely reported in South Korean subjects. CT with sagittal reconstructions and MRI are helpful for diagnosis and spinal cord involvement. When neurologic symptoms develop, decompressive laminectomy should be done immediately and the surgical outcome is generally good if hyperintense intramedullary signal changes of spinal cord have not yet developed.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To relate different types of radiographic contrast material distributions to anatomic compartments by using cadaveric specimens and to relate the injection site to treatment-induced discomfort and therapeutic effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The contrast material distributions of selective nerve root blocks (SNRBs) in 36 patients (13 women, 23 men; mean age, 52 years; age range, 22-88 years) were graded by two radiologists in conference as type 1 (tubular appearance), type 2 (nerve root visible as filling defect), or type 3 (nerve root not visible). These patterns were correlated with pain reduction after 15 minutes and 2 weeks (with a visual analogue scale of 100-mm length). In addition, 30 nerve roots were injected with iodine-containing contrast material and blue dye in three cadaveric specimens. Radiographs were compared with anatomic sections. RESULTS: After 15 minutes and 2 weeks, 75\% and 86\% of the patients, respectively, reported pain relief. Mean pain relief length after 15 minutes for type 1 distribution was 60 mm; for type 2, 44 mm; and for type 3, 22 mm; and after 2 weeks, it was 34 mm for type 1, 31 mm for type 2, and 57 mm for type 3. There was no correlation between early and late response. Pain during intervention was less pronounced in type 2 injection, compared with type 1 (P = .002). On the basis of anatomic sections, type 1 injection was intraepineural; type 2, extraepineural; and type 3, paraneural. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic SNRB is effective in sciatica, but early response does not predict the effect after 2 weeks. Type 1 injections are more painful than type 2 injections.},

  abstract = {This paperback edition is a reprint of the 2000 edition. This book provides an overview of the theory and application of linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models in the analysis of grouped data, such as longitudinal data, repeated measures, and multilevel data. A unified model-building strategy for both linear and nonlinear models is presented and applied to the analysis of over 20 real datasets from a wide variety of areas, including pharmacokinetics, agriculture, and manufacturing. A strong emphasis is placed on the use of graphical displays at the various phases of the model-building process, starting with exploratory plots of the data and concluding with diagnostic plots to assess the adequacy of a fitted model. Over 170 figures areincluded in the book. The NLME package for analyzing mixed-effects models in R and S-PLUS, developed by the authors, provides the underlying software for implementing the methods presented in the text, being described and illustrated in detail throughout the book. The balanced mix of real data examples, modeling software, and theory makes this book a useful reference for practitioners using mixed-effects models in their data analyses. It can also be used as a text for a one-semester graduate-level applied course in mixed-effects models. Researchers in statistical computing will also find this book appealing for its presentation of novel and efficient computational methods for fitting linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models.},

Recent work has led to the discovery of the glymphatic system, a glial-dependent perivascular network that subserves a pseudolymphatic function in the brain. Within the glymphatic pathway, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) enters the brain via periarterial spaces, passes into the interstitium via perivascular astrocytic aquaporin-4, and then drives the perivenous drainage of interstitial fluid (ISF) and its solute. Here, we review the role of the glymphatic pathway in CNS physiology, the factors known to regulate glymphatic flow, and the pathologic processes in which a breakdown of glymphatic CSF-ISF exchange has been implicated in disease initiation and progression. Important areas of future research, including manipulation of glymphatic activity aiming to improve waste clearance and therapeutic agent delivery, are also discussed.},

The degenerative process including disc bulging, facet arthritis, and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy contributes to the appearance of symptoms of spinal stenosis in these patients. PURPOSE: The etiology, prevalence, biomechanics, classification, symptomatology, and treatment of degenerative lumbar scoliosis in association with spinal stenosis are reviewed. STUDY DESIGN: Review study. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of studies focused on all parameters concerning degenerative scoliosis associated with stenosis. RESULTS: There is a variety of treatment methods of degenerative scoliosis based on symptomatology and radiologic measurements of scoliosis and stenosis. Satisfactory clinical results reported in relevant retrospective studies after operative treatment range from 83\% to 96\% but with increased percentage of complications. An algorithm for operative treatment corresponding to a newly proposed classification system of degenerative lumbar scoliosis with associated canal stenosis is presented. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increasing prevalence of degenerative scoliosis in the aged population. Even though the exact percentage of patients with symptomatology of spinal stenosis is not known, the main goal is to provide pain relief and improved functional lifestyle with minimum intervention.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE The flexed posture of the proximal (L1-3) or distal (L4-S1) lumbar spine increases the diameter of the spinal canal and neuroforamina and can relieve symptoms of neurogenic claudication. Distal lumbar flexion can result in pelvic retroversion; therefore, in cases of flexible sagittal imbalance, pelvic retroversion may be compensatory for lumbar stenosis and not solely compensatory for the sagittal imbalance as previously thought. The authors investigate underlying causes for pelvic retroversion in patients with flexible sagittal imbalance. METHODS One hundred thirty-eight patients with sagittal imbalance who underwent a total of 148 fusion procedures of the thoracolumbar spine were identified from a prospective clinical database. Radiographic parameters were obtained from images preoperatively, intraoperatively, and at 6-month and 2-year follow-up. A cohort of 24 patients with flexible sagittal imbalance was identified and individually matched with a control cohort of 23 patients with fixed deformities. Flexible deformities were defined as a 10\textdegree{} change in lumbar lordosis between weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing images. Pelvic retroversion was quantified as the ratio of pelvic tilt (PT) to pelvic incidence (PI). RESULTS The average difference between lumbar lordosis on supine MR images and standing radiographs was 15\textdegree{} in the flexible cohort. Sixty-eight percent of the patients in the flexible cohort were diagnosed preoperatively with lumbar stenosis compared with only 22\% in the fixed sagittal imbalance cohort (p = 0.0032). There was no difference between the flexible and fixed cohorts with regard to C-2 sagittal vertical axis (SVA) (p = 0.95) or C-7 SVA (p = 0.43). When assessing for postural compensation by pelvic retroversion in the stenotic patients and nonstenotic patients, the PT/PI ratio was found to be significantly greater in the patients with stenosis (p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS For flexible sagittal imbalance, preoperative attention should be given to the root cause of the sagittal misalignment, which could be compensation for lumbar stenosis. Pelvic retroversion can be compensatory for both the lumbar stenosis as well as for sagittal imbalance.},

This is the first reported case of a spontaneous ventral extradural spinal meningeal cyst causing cord compression. Cyst-peritoneal shunt was effective in the treatment of the case and it should be considered in cases in which complete resection of the cyst is made more difficult or risky by the need of more aggressive surgical maneuvers.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adult spinal deformity is a prevalent cause of pain and disability. Established measures of sagittal spinopelvic alignment such as sagittal vertical axis and pelvic tilt can be modified by postural compensation, including pelvic retroversion, knee flexion, and the use of assistive devices for standing. We introduce the T1 pelvic angle, a novel measure of sagittal alignment that simultaneously accounts for both spinal inclination and pelvic retroversion. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of the T1 pelvic angle and other established sagittal alignment measures and to correlate these parameters with health-related quality-of-life measures. METHODS: This is a multicenter, prospective, cross-sectional analysis of consecutive patients with adult spinal deformity. Inclusion criteria were adult spinal deformity, an age of greater than eighteen years, and any of the following: scoliosis, a Cobb angle of {$\geq$} 20\textdegree, sagittal vertical axis of {$\geq$} 5 cm, thoracic kyphosis of {$\geq$} 60\textdegree, and pelvic tilt of {$\geq$} 25\textdegree. Clinical measures of disability included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-22, and Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaires. RESULTS: Five hundred and fifty-nine consecutive patients with adult spinal deformity (mean age, 52.5 years) were enrolled. The T1 pelvic angle correlated with the sagittal vertical axis (r = 0.837), pelvic incidence minus lumbar lordosis (r = 0.889), and pelvic tilt (0.933). Categorizing the patients by increasing T1 pelvic angle ({$<$}10\textdegree, 10\textdegree{} to 20\textdegree, 21\textdegree{} to 30\textdegree, and {$>$} 30\textdegree ) revealed a significant and progressive worsening in health-related quality of life (p {$<$} 0.001 for all). The T1 pelvic angle and sagittal vertical axis correlated with the ODI (0.435 and 0.455), SF-36 Physical Component Summary (-0.445 and -0.458), and SRS (-0.358 and -0.383) (p {$<$} 0.001 for all). Utilizing a linear regression analysis, a T1 pelvic angle of 20\textdegree{} corresponded to a severe disability (an ODI of {$>$}40), and the meaningful change in T1 pelvic angle corresponding to one minimal clinically important difference was 4.1\textdegree{} on the ODI. CONCLUSIONS: The T1 pelvic angle correlates with health-related quality of life in patients with adult spinal deformity. The T1 pelvic angle is related to both pelvic tilt and sagittal vertical axis; however, unlike sagittal vertical axis, it does not vary on the basis of the extent of pelvic retroversion or patient support in standing. Since the T1 pelvic angle is an angular and not a linear measure, it does not require calibration of the radiograph. Thus, the T1 pelvic angle measures sagittal deformity independent of many postural compensatory mechanisms, and it can be useful as a preoperative planning tool, with a target T1 pelvic angle of {$<$} 14\textdegree. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic Level II. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.},

Dynamic MRI consisted of axial and sagittal cine phase-contrast sequences. CSF and tonsillar motion were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated, and the subarachnoid space at the foramen magnum measured. In Chiari patients, cine phase-contrast MRI detected the abnormal pulsatile motion of the cerebellar tonsils, which produced a selective obstruction of CSF flow from the cranial cavity to the spine. The amplitude of the tonsillar pulsation and the severity of the arachnoid space reduction were associated with the symptom of cough-strain headache, but not with the presence of syringomyelia. The finding of abnormal valve dynamics of the cerebellar hernia revealed by cine phase-contrast MRI conforms to the pathophysiologic mechanisms suggested in pressure register studies and opens a new possibility in the presurgical assessment of Chiari patients with exertional symptoms.},

However, the result of bilateral facetectomy on the stability of the thoracolumbar spine has not been studied. A nonlinear three-dimensional finite element (FE) model of thoracolumbar T11-L1 was built to explore the influence of bilateral facetectomy. The FE model of T11-L1 was validated against published experimental results under various physiological loadings. The FE model with bilateral facetectomy was evaluated under flexion, extension, lateral bending and axial rotation to determine alterations in kinematics. Results show that bilateral facetectomy causes increase in motion, considerable increase in axial rotation and least increase in lateral bending. Removal of facets did not result in significant change in the sagittal motion in flexion and extension.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of intracranial and intraspinal CSF flow was accomplished by the use of cardiac gated gradient echo magnetic resonance (MR) technique. Normal patterns of pulsatile flow within the ventricles, cisterns and cervical subarachnoid space were established by this technique and these observations were compared to prior description of CSF flow. With systole there is downward (caudal) flow of CSF in the aqueduct of Sylvius, the foramen of Magendie, the basal cisterns and the dorsal and ventral subarachnoid spaces while during diastole, upward (cranial) flow of CSF in these same structures is seen. The relationships between the cardiac cycle and the CSF pulsations are demonstrated on both magnitude reconstruction and phase reconstruction MR images. Calculations of actual fluid velocity within CSF containing spaces can be obtained from the phase reconstruction images and holds promise for a more accurate analysis of CSF flow. In conditions which result in alterations of flow, cine MR dramatically shows either obstruction or excessively turbulent flow within the CSF pathways. The site of obstructed flow whether in the third ventricle, aqueduct, fourth ventricle, or subarachnoid space can be appreciated by changes in or absence of the normal hypointense signal. Cystic cord lesions such as congenital syringohydromyelia and posttraumatic spinal cord cysts may show pulsatile flow of CSF, a fact which can relate to progressive enlargement of these cysts. The distinction between myelomalacia and cyst formation in the cord is facilitated by the technique. Although the use of cine MR for the analysis of CSF flow is in its infancy, our experience indicates that this technique is useful in a wide range of pathological conditions including, but not limited to, conditions resulting in hydrocephalus or cystic cord lesions.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cardiac-gated phase-contrast MR technique was used to acquire images at 14 time points evenly spaced through the cardiac cycle in 10 volunteers and eight patients with Chiari I malformation. Instantaneous CSF velocities were displayed as temporal and spatial plots and examined for homogeneity, differences between flow anterior and flow posterior to the spinal cord, synchronous bidirectional flow, and equivalence of the caudad flow and craniad flow in each voxel. Indexes for flow homogeneity, synchronous bidirectional flow, and preferential flow direction were calculated, and differences between the patient and volunteer groups were tested for significance with a t test of the means. RESULTS: In volunteers, diastolic velocity peaked in two regions in the anterior paramedial subarachnoid space. Patients had greater inhomogeneity of flow than volunteers. They had substantially increased flow (jets) in the anterior paramedial locations. Synchronous bidirectional flow was seen in six of the patients and in none of the volunteers. Cephalad flow in the jets or nodes (P =.05), proportion of cephalad and caudad flow in the anterior compartment (P {$<$}.005 for both), and the fraction of voxels with flow directionality (P =.03) differed significantly between patients and volunteers. CONCLUSION: CSF flow in symptomatic patients with Chiari I malformation, unlike that in volunteer subjects, is characterized by flow jets, regions with a preponderance of flow in one direction, and synchronous bidirectional flow.},

  abstract = {OBJECT Extradural decompression is a minimally invasive technique for treating Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) that avoids the complications of dural opening. While there is no agreement on which surgical method is optimal, mounting evidence demonstrates that extradural decompression effectively treats clinical symptoms, with a minimal reoperation rate. Neurological symptoms such as headache may be related to obstructed flow of CSF, and one aspect of successful extradural decompression is improved CSF dynamics. In this series, the authors report on their use of phase-contrast cine flow MRI to assess CSF flow as well as satisfactory decompression. METHODS The authors describe their first surgical series of 18 patients with CM-I undergoing extradural decompression and correlate clinical improvement with radiological changes. Patients were categorized as having complete, partial, or no resolution of their symptoms. Posterior fossa area, cisterna magna area, and tonsillar herniation were assessed on T2-weighted MRI, whereas improvement of CSF flow was evaluated with phase-contrast cine flow MRI. All patients received standard pre- and postoperative MRI studies; 8 (44.4\%) patients had pre- and postoperative phase-contrast cine, while the rest underwent cine studies only postoperatively. RESULTS All 18 patients presented with symptomatic CM-I, with imaging studies demonstrating tonsillar herniation {$\geq$} 5 mm, and 2 patients had associated syringomelia. All patients underwent suboccipital decompression and C-1 laminectomy with splitting of the dura. Patients with complete resolution of their symptoms had a greater relative increase in cisterna magna area compared with those with only partial improvement (p = 0.022). In addition, in those with complete improvement the preoperative cisterna magna area was smaller than in those who had either partial (0.020) or no (0.025) improvement. Ten (91\%) of the 11 patients with improved flow also had improvement in their symptoms. There was 1 postoperative complication of dysphagia and dysphonia. None of the patients have required a second operation. CONCLUSIONS Extradural decompression has the potential to be the first-line treatment for CM-I but has been lacking an objective measure by which to assess surgical success as well as the need for reoperation. An increase in the CSF spaces and improved CSF dynamics may be associated with resolution of clinical symptoms. Including cine imaging as part of routine pre- and postoperative evaluation can help identify which patients are most likely to benefit from surgery.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: We hypothesize that surgical decompression for Chiari malformation type 1 (CM-1) is associated with statistically significant decrease in tonsillar pulsatility and that the degree of pulsatility can be reliably assessed regardless of the experience level of the reader. METHODS: An Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant retrospective study was performed on 22 children with CM-1 (8 males; mean age 11.4 years) who had cardiac-gated true-FISP sequence and phase-contrast cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow imaging as parts of routine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging before and after surgical decompression. The surgical technique (decompression with or without duraplasty) was recorded for each patient. Three independent radiologists with different experience levels assessed tonsillar pulsatility qualitatively and quantitatively and assessed peritonsillar CSF flow qualitatively. Results were analyzed. To evaluate reliability, Fleiss kappa for multiple raters on categorical variables and intra-class correlation for agreement in pulsatility ratings were calculated. RESULTS: After surgical decompression, the degree of tonsillar pulsatility appreciably decreased, confirmed by t test, both qualitatively (p values {$<$}0.001, {$<$}0.001, and 0.045 for three readers) and quantitatively (amount of decrease/p value for three readers 0.7 mm/{$<$}0.001, 0.7 mm/{$<$}0.001, and 0.5 mm/0.022). There was a better agreement among the readers in quantitative assessment of tonsillar pulsatility (kappa 0.753-0.834), compared to qualitative assessment of pulsatility (kappa 0.472-0.496) and qualitative assessment of flow (kappa 0.056 to 0.203). Posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty led to a larger decrease in tonsillar pulsatility, compared to posterior fossa decompression alone. CONCLUSION: Tonsillar pulsatility in CM-1 is significantly reduced after surgical decompression. Quantitative assessment of tonsillar pulsatility was more reliable across readers than qualitative assessments of tonsillar pulsatility or CSF flow.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We studied changes in the cervical spine curvature in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy who underwent one- or two-level central corpectomy and iliac bone grafting without the use of instrumentation. METHODS: Curvature of the fused segment and of the whole cervical spine was evaluated on preoperative and follow-up x-rays in 93 patients (30 underwent one-level corpectomy, and 63 underwent two-level corpectomy). In 59 patients, the changes in the cervical spine curvature were studied using one follow-up x-ray; in the other 34 patients, the changes were studied on x-rays obtained at two or more follow-up visits. The sagittal alignment of the fused segment was categorized as lordotic ({$>$}+5 degrees), straight (+5 to -5 degrees) or kyphotic ({$>$}-5 degrees). The whole spine curvature also was recorded as lordotic, straight, or kyphotic. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 22.2 months (range, 6-71 mo), there was a mean change of -10.4 degrees in the segmental curvature (P {$<$} 0.001). The fused segment sagittal alignment also worsened (lordotic angles becoming straight or kyphotic and straight angles becoming kyphotic) in 44 patients (47\%)(P {$<$} 0.001). However, serial studies in 34 patients (mean first and last follow-ups, 11.9 and 30.8 mo, respectively) did not demonstrate significant worsening of the kyphotic angle or the sagittal alignment over time (P = 0.9). Whole spine curvature worsened in 33 (35\%) of the 93 patients (P {$<$} 0.001); serial studies did not reveal a significant change (P = 0.9). Patients improved in their functional status from a preoperative mean Nurick grade of 2.9 (range, 1-5) to a follow-up mean Nurick grade of 1.5 (range, 0-4) (P {$<$} 0.001). Patients with a kyphotic change in their whole spine curvature (n = 33) and those without such change (n = 60) had a similar functional outcome (mean change in Nurick grade, 1.5 and 1.4, respectively). CONCLUSION: Cervical spine curvature tended to undergo a kyphotic change at the fused segment in 47\% of patients and a kyphotic change of the whole spine curvature in 35\% of patients who underwent one- or two-level uninstrumented central corpectomy. This kyphotic change in the cervical spine, which stabilizes within 1 year after surgery, is not progressive, and it does not affect neurological outcome in these patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The glymphatic (glial-lymphatic) pathway is a fluid-clearance pathway identified in the rodent brain in 2012. This pathway subserves the flow of CSF into the brain along arterial perivascular spaces and subsequently into the brain interstitium, facilitated by aquaporin 4 (AQP4) water channels. The pathway then directs flow towards the venous perivascular and perineuronal spaces, ultimately clearing solutes from the neuropil into meningeal and cervical lymphatic drainage vessels. In rodents, the glymphatic pathway is predominantly active during sleep, when the clearance of harmful metabolites such as amyloid {$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}) increases two-fold relative to the waking state. Glymphatic dysfunction, probably related to perturbed AQP4 expression, has been shown in animal models of traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. The recent characterisations of the glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic systems in rodents and in humans call for revaluation of the anatomical routes for CSF-interstitial fluid flow and the physiological role that these pathways play in CNS health. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: Several features of the glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic systems have been shown to be present in humans. MRI scans with intrathecally administered contrast agent show that CSF flows along pathways that closely resemble the glymphatic system outlined in rodents. Furthermore, PET studies have revealed that A{$\beta$} accumulates in the healthy brain after a single night of sleep deprivation, suggesting that the human glymphatic pathway might also be primarily active during sleep. Other PET studies have shown that CSF clearance of A{$\beta$} and tau tracers is reduced in patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with healthy controls. The observed reduction in CSF clearance was associated with increasing grey-matter concentrations of A{$\beta$} in the human brain, consistent with findings in mice showing that decreased glymphatic function leads to A{$\beta$} accumulation. Altered AQP4 expression is also evident in brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease or normal pressure hydrocephalus; glymphatic MRI scans of patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus show reduced CSF tracer entry and clearance. WHERE NEXT?: Research is needed to confirm whether specific factors driving glymphatic flow in rodents also apply to humans. Longitudinal imaging studies evaluating human CSF dynamics will determine whether a causal link exists between reduced brain solute clearance and the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Assessment of glymphatic function after stroke or traumatic brain injury could identify whether this function correlates with neurological recovery. New insights into how behaviour and genetics modify glymphatic function, and how this function decompensates in disease, should lead to the development of new preventive and diagnostic tools and novel therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microdiscectomy or open discectomy (MD/OD) are the standard procedures for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation and they involve removal of the portion of the intervertebral disc compressing the nerve root or spinal cord (or both) with or without the aid of a headlight loupe or microscope magnification. Potential advantages of newer minimally invasive discectomy (MID) procedures over standard MD/OD include less blood loss, less postoperative pain, shorter hospitalisation and earlier return to work. OBJECTIVES: To compare the benefits and harms of MID versus MD/OD for management of lumbar intervertebral discopathy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (November 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2013) and EMBASE (1974 to November 2013) and applied no language restrictions. We also contacted experts in the field for additional studies and reviewed reference lists of relevant studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials (QRCTs) that compared MD/OD with a MID (percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar or transforaminal lumbar discectomy, transmuscular tubular microdiscectomy and automated percutaneous lumbar discectomy) for treatment of adults with lumbar radiculopathy secondary to discopathy. We evaluated the following primary outcomes: pain related to sciatica or low back pain (LBP) as measured by a visual analogue scale, sciatic specific outcomes such as neurological deficit of lower extremity or bowel/urinary incontinence and functional outcomes (including daily activity or return to work). We also evaluated the following secondary outcomes: complications of surgery, duration of hospital stay, postoperative opioid use, quality of life and overall participant satisfaction. Two authors checked data abstractions and articles for inclusion. We resolved discrepancies by consensus. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We used pre-developed forms to extract data and two authors independently assessed risk of bias. For statistical analysis, we used risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 11 studies (1172 participants). We assessed seven out of 11 studies as having high overall risk of bias. There was low-quality evidence that MID was associated with worse leg pain than MD/OD at follow-up ranging from six months to two years (e.g. at one year: MD 0.13, 95\% CI 0.09 to 0.16), but differences were small (less than 0.5 points on a 0 to 10 scale) and did not meet standard thresholds for clinically meaningful differences. There was low-quality evidence that MID was associated with worse LBP than MD/OD at six-month follow-up (MD 0.35, 95\% CI 0.19 to 0.51) and at two years (MD 0.54, 95\% CI 0.29 to 0.79). There was no significant difference at one year (0 to 10 scale: MD 0.19, 95\% CI -0.22 to 0.59). Statistical heterogeneity was small to high (I(2) statistic = 35\% at six months, 90\% at one year and 65\% at two years). There were no clear differences between MID techniques and MD/OD on other primary outcomes related to functional disability (Oswestry Disability Index greater than six months postoperatively) and persistence of motor and sensory neurological deficits, though evidence on neurological deficits was limited by the small numbers of participants in the trials with neurological deficits at baseline. There was just one study for each of the sciatica-specific outcomes including the Sciatica Bothersomeness Index and the Sciatica Frequency Index, which did not need further analysis. For secondary outcomes, MID was associated with lower risk of surgical site and other infections, but higher risk of re-hospitalisation due to recurrent disc herniation. In addition, MID was associated with slightly lower quality of life (less than 5 points on a 100-point scale) on some measures of quality of life, such as some physical subclasses of the 36-item Short Form. Some trials found MID to be associated with shorter duration of hospitalisation than MD/OD, but results were inconsistent. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: MID may be inferior in terms of relief of leg pain, LBP and re-hospitalisation; however, differences in pain relief appeared to be small and may not be clinically important. Potential advantages of MID are lower risk of surgical site and other infections. MID may be associated with shorter hospital stay but the evidence was inconsistent. Given these potential advantages, more research is needed to define appropriate indications for MID as an alternative to standard MD/OD.},

These webs tend to occur in the upper thoracic spine and may produce a characteristic deformity of the cord that we term the "scalpel sign." We describe 14 patients whose imaging studies demonstrated the scalpel sign. Ten of 13 patients who underwent MR imaging demonstrated T2WI cord signal-intensity changes, and 7 of these patients also demonstrated syringomyelia adjacent to the level of indentation. Seven patients underwent surgery, with 5 demonstrating an arachnoid web as the cause of the dorsal indentation demonstrated on preoperative imaging. Although the webs themselves are rarely demonstrated on imaging, we propose that the scalpel sign is a reliable indicator of their presence and should prompt consideration of surgical lysis, which is potentially curative.},

We prospectively investigated electrocardiographic (ECG)-gated cine true fast imaging with steady-state precession (FISP) sequence on volunteers to test a sequence for demonstrating brain pulsation and movements of intracranial structures related to CSF dynamics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven healthy volunteers were investigated with prospectively ECG-gated cine true-FISP in the midsagittal plane. A total of 50 phases were recorded per cardiac cycle and per volunteer. The lamina terminalis was chosen to study the pulsatility of the brain, and the optic recess diameter was chosen for means of objective quantification of the degree of pulsatility. RESULTS: Pulsatile motion of the lamina terminalis was apparent in all volunteers on the cine mode. The mean diameter of the optic recess was 2.5 mm. The greatest change in diameter in 1 volunteer was 1.5 mm. The mean change in diameter was 40\% during 1 cardiac cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Cine true-FISP sequence is a well-suited method for investigations of passive movements of the ventricular system. It shows pulsations of the brain as well as passive changes caused by CSF dynamics with high temporal and spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. OBJECTIVE: To determine best criteria for radiological determination of postoperative subaxial cervical fusion to be applied to current clinical practice and ongoing future research assessing fusion to standardize assessment and improve comparability. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Despite availability of multiple imaging modalities and criteria, there remains no method of determining cervical fusion with absolute certainty, nor clear consensus on specific criteria to be applied. METHODS: A systematic search in MEDLINE/Cochrane Collaboration Library (through March 2014). Included studies assessed C2 to C7 via anterior or posterior approach, at 12 weeks or more postoperative, with any graft or implant. Overall body of evidence with respect to 6 posited key questions was determined using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality precepts. RESULTS: Of plain radiographical modalities, there is moderate evidence that the interspinous process motion method ({$<$}1 mm) is more accurate than the Cobb angle method for assessing anterior cervical fusion. Of the advanced imaging modalities, there is moderate evidence that computed tomography (CT) is more accurate and reliable than magnetic resonance imaging in assessing anterior cervical fusion. There is insufficient evidence regarding the optimal modality and criteria for assessing posterior cervical fusions and insufficient evidence to support a single time point after surgery as being optimal for determining fusion, although some evidence suggest that reliability of radiography and CT improves with increasing time postoperatively. CONCLUSION: We recommend using less than 1-mm motion as the initial modality for determining anterior cervical arthrodesis for both clinical and research applications. If further imaging is needed because of indeterminate radiographical evaluation, we recommend CT, which has relatively high accuracy and reliability, but due to greater radiation exposure and cost, it is not routinely suggested. We recommend that plain radiographs also be the initial method of determining posterior cervical fusion but suggest a lower threshold for obtaining CT scans because dynamic radiographs may not be as useful if spinous processes have been removed by laminectomy.

As a consequence, intracranial hypotension is less recognized as a potential cause of syringomyelia or mistaken with Chiari type 1 malformation. The pathogeny is poorly understood, and we lack diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this particular setting. CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a 45-year-old patient who developed syringomyelia after about 10 years of undiagnosed intracranial hypotension caused by traumatic C6 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. Surgical closing of the leak was required to treat intracranial hypotension after failure of conservative measures and blind epidural patches. It led to a marked improvement of cerebral and spinal signs. We discuss the pathogeny of syringomyelia caused by intracranial hypotension and highlight a mechanical theory of hyperpressure against the cervical spine due to blockage of CSF flow by descent of cerebellar tonsils at the foramen magnum level. We describe discriminating clinical and radiologic signs to differentiate intracranial hypotension from Chiari type 1 malformation and discuss mechanisms and causality relating trauma and intracranial hypotension. CONCLUSIONS: Syringomyelia can be a consequence of long-term progression of intracranial hypotension, which must be differentiated from Chiari type 1 malformation. In our case, resolution was achieved by detecting and closing the CSF leak causing the intracranial hypotension. Reports of similar cases are necessary to understand the origin of CSF leak in traumatic intracranial hypotension and assess the best therapeutic strategy.},

  abstract = {We report a rare case of a large intraparotid facial nerve schwannoma (IFNS) in a 51-year-old female who presented with a painless, slow growing left parotid mass without peripheral facial nerve palsy, with non-specific findings at preoperative diagnostic work-up, that was treated with conservative surgery. Management of IFNS is very challenging because the diagnosis is often made intra-operatively, and in most cases resection may lead to severe facial nerve paralysis, with important aesthetic sequelae. Our experience suggests a new surgical option, namely intra-capsular enucleation using a microscope, currently used for schwannomas arising from a major peripheral nerve, which should be a safe and reliable treatment for IFNS. This surgical technique is the first experience of intracapsular microenucleation of facial nerve schwannoma described in the literature and allows preservation of the nerve without resection and reconstruction.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Transverse sinus stenosis (TSS) is common in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), but its effect on the course and outcome of IIH is unknown. We evaluated differences in TSS characteristics between patients with IIH with "good" vs. "poor" clinical courses. METHODS: All patients with IIH seen in our institution after September 2009 who underwent a high-quality standardized brain magnetic resonance venogram (MRV) were included. Patients were categorized as having a good or poor clinical course based on medical record review. The location and percent of each TSS were determined for each patient, and were correlated to the clinical outcome. RESULTS: We included 51 patients. Forty-six patients had bilateral TSS. The median average percent stenosis was 56\%. Seventy-one percent of patients had stenoses {$>$}50\%. Thirty-five of the 51 patients (69\%) had no final visual field loss. Eight patients (16\%) had a clinical course classified as poor. There was no difference in the average percent stenosis between those with good clinical courses vs those with poor courses (62\% vs. 56\%, p = 0.44). There was no difference in the percent stenosis based on the visual field grade (p = 0.38). CSF opening pressure was not associated with either location or degree of TSS. CONCLUSION: TSS is common, if not universal, among patients with IIH, and is almost always bilateral. There is no correlation between the degree of TSS and the clinical course, including visual field loss, among patients with IIH, suggesting that clinical features, not the degree of TSS, should be used to determine management in IIH.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Among all primary spinal neoplasms, approximately two-thirds are intradural extramedullary lesions; nerve sheath tumors, mainly neurofibromas and schwannomas, comprise approximately half of them. Given the rarity of these lesions, reports of surgical complications are limited. The aim of this study was to identify the rates of new or worsening neurological deficits and surgical complications associated with the resection of spinal nerve sheath tumors and the potential factors related to these outcomes. METHODS Patients were identified through a search of an institutional neuropathology database and a separate review of current procedural terminology (CPT) codes. Age, sex, clinical presentation, presence of neurofibromatosis (NF), tumor type, tumor location, extent of resection characterized as gross total or subtotal, use of intraoperative neuromonitoring, surgical complications, presence of neurological deficit, and clinical follow-up were recorded. RESULTS Two hundred twenty-one tumors in 199 patients with a mean age of 45 years were identified. Fifty-three tumors were neurofibromas; 163, schwannomas; and 5, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). There were 70 complications in 221 cases, a rate of 32\%, which included 34 new or worsening sensory symptoms (15\%), 12 new or worsening motor deficits (5\%), 10 CSF leaks or pseudomeningoceles (4\%), 11 wound infections (5\%), 5 cases of spinal deformity (2\%), and 6 others (2 spinal epidural hematomas, 1 nonoperative cranial subdural hematoma, 1 deep venous thrombosis, 1 case of urinary retention, and 1 recurrent laryngeal nerve injury). Complications were more common in cervical (36\%) and lumbosacral (38\%) tumors than in thoracic (18\%) lesions (p = 0.021). Intradural and dumbbell lesions were associated with higher rates of CSF leakage, pseudomeningocele, and wound infection. Complications were present in 18 neurofibromas (34\%), 50 schwannomas (31\%), and 2 MPNSTs (40\%); the differences in frequency were not significant (p = 0.834). Higher complication rates were observed in patients with NF than in patients without (38\% vs 30\%, p = 0.189), although rates were higher in NF Type 2 than in Type 1 (64\% vs 31\%). There was no difference in the use of intraoperative neuromonitoring when comparing cases with surgical complications and those without (67\% vs 69\%, p = 0.797). However, the use of neuromonitoring was associated with a significantly higher rate of gross-total resection (79\% vs 66\%, p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS Resection is a safe and effective treatment for spinal nerve sheath tumors. Approximately 30\% of patients developed a postoperative complication, most commonly new or worsening sensory deficits. This rate probably represents an inevitable complication of nerve sheath tumor surgery given the intimacy of these lesions with functional neural elements.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Transverse sinus stenosis is an imaging finding very highly associated with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Patients with the Chiari I malformation may potentially have elevated ICP due to impairment of CSF flow at the foramen magnum. This study evaluated whether patients with Chiari I malformation have transverse sinus stenosis and other imaging findings indicative of elevated ICP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with Chiari I malformation treated surgically and 76 control subjects were identified retrospectively. All control subjects and all patients with Chiari I malformation (preoperatively) underwent standardized contrast-enhanced brain MRI including a contrast-enhanced 3D T1-weighted sequence from which curved reformats of the transverse sinuses were generated. Two different readers blinded to the diagnosis then independently evaluated these curved reformats for severity of transverse sinus stenosis. Orbital and skull-base findings previously described in association with elevated ICP were also evaluated. Frequency of MRI findings between the two groups was compared. RESULTS: Patients with Chiari I malformation had significantly greater frequency of unilateral or bilateral transverse sinus stenosis than did control subjects (p {$<$} 0.001). There was complete interreader agreement on presence or absence of transverse sinus stenosis by patient ({$\kappa$} = 1.0 [95\% CI, 0.89-1.0]). Logistic regression analysis controlling for age, sex, and body mass index found that transverse sinus stenosis significantly predicted Chiari I malformation versus control status (odds ratio, 11.2 [95\% CI, 2.1-59.0]; p = 0.004) but that no other features were significantly associated with the Chiari I malformation. Patients with Chiari I malformation who had transverse sinus stenosis had significantly greater pituitary flattening than did those without transverse sinus stenosis (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Patients with Chiari I malformation have higher likelihood of transverse sinus stenosis, which may reflect associated elevated ICP.},

Surgery-related indications were: 1) radiculopathy without low-back pain; 2) no spinal instability demonstrated on dynamic radiographs; and 3) age older than 40 years. Seven patients, four men and three women, fulfilled these criteria and underwent endoscopic decompressive surgery. Their mean age was 60.9 years (range 42-70 years). No subluxation was present in four patients, whereas Meyerding Grade I slippage was demonstrated in three. For endoscopic decompression, a skin incision of 16 to 18 mm in length was made, and fenestration was performed to identify the affected nerve root. The proximal stump of the ragged edge of the spondylotic lesion, and the fibrocartilaginous mass compressing the nerve root were removed. The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 22 months (mean 11.7 months). Clinical outcome was evaluated using Gill criteria; in three patients the outcome was excellent, and in four it was good. This new endoscopic technique was useful in the decompression of nerve roots affected by spondylolysis, the technique was minimally invasive, and the clinical results were acceptable.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A literature review was conducted to integrate and compile available reports on postoperative C5 palsy. OBJECTIVES: To review the clinical features, possible pathogenesis, and procedures for treatment and prevention of postoperative C5 palsy as a complication of surgery for cervical compression myelopathy. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although postoperative C5 palsy develops in approximately 5\% of patients after decompression surgery of the cervical spine, its pathogenesis and the options for prevention and treatment remain unidentified and many controversies exist. METHOD: We reviewed and analyzed papers published from 1986 to 2002 regarding C5 palsy as a postoperative complication. Statistical comparisons were made when appropriate. RESULTS: Postoperative C5 palsy is reported to occur in an average of 4.6\% of patients after surgery for cervical compression myelopathy. No significant differences were noted between patients undergoing anterior decompression and fusion and laminoplasty, nor were distinctions apparent between unilateral hinge laminoplasty and French-door laminoplasty, or between cervical spondylotic myelopathy and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Two theories were put forth to account for the pathogenesis of C5 palsy: nerve root injury and segmental spinal cord disorder. Neither of these hypotheses has been consistently supported and evidence to refute each hypothesis can be found in the literature. Recently, surgeons have advocated foraminotomy combined with laminoplasty to prevent or treat C5 palsy, but further studies into the efficacy of this procedure are needed. Although patients with C5 palsy generally have a good prognosis for neurologic and functional recovery, those with severe paralysis require significantly longer recovery times when compared to more mild cases. CONCLUSION: The incidence of postoperative C5 palsy has been reported at 4.6\% after surgery for cervical compression myelopathy and this value has not varied with different surgical procedures or disease etiologies. The pathogenesis of postoperative C5 palsy remains unclear at the present time. Patients with postoperative C5 palsy generally have a good prognosis for functional recovery, but the severely paralyzed cases required significantly longer recovery times than the mild cases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Embolization of spinal dural arteriovenous fistulae (SDVAFs) has emerged as an alternative to surgery. However, surgical disconnection is a simple and effective procedure. OBJECTIVE: To review results and complications of surgical treatment of 154 consecutive SDAVFs. METHODS: The records of 154 consecutive patients with SDAVFs were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: There were 120 males and 34 females (male/female ratio 3.5:1, mean age 63.6 years). The SDAVFs were located at the thoracic level in 92 patients and at the lumbar and sacral spine levels in 45 and 15 patients, respectively. The most common presenting symptoms were motor dysfunction (65 patients), sensory loss (31 patients), and paresthesias without sensory loss (13 patients). The mean interval from symptom onset to definitive diagnosis was 24.7 months (median 12 months). Surgery resulted in complete exclusion of the fistula at first attempt in 146 patients (95\%). There were no deaths or major neurological complications related to the surgery. Six percent of patients experienced subjective or objective worsening of preoperative symptoms and signs by the time of discharge that persisted at follow-up. Other surgical complications consisted of wound infection in 2 patients and deep venous thrombosis in 3. Eight patients were lost to follow-up; 141 patients (96.6\%) experienced improvement (120 patients, 82.2\%) or stability (21 patients, 14.4\%) of motor function at last follow-up compared with their preoperative status. Other symptoms such as numbness, sphincter dysfunction, and dysesthesias/neuropathic pain improved in 51.5\%, 45\%, and 32.6\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Surgical obliteration of SDAVFs is safe and very effective. Prognosis of motor function is favorable after surgical treatment.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Patient age at presentation with congenital atlantoaxial dislocation (CAAD) is variable. In addition, the factors determining irreducibility or reducibility in these patients remain unclear. The facets appear to contribute to the stability of the joint, albeit to an unknown extent. The objective of this paper was to study the characteristics of C1-2 facets in these patients and their bearing on the clinicoradiological presentation and management. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with CAAD were studied. Fifteen patients had irreducible CAAD (IrAAD); 3 of these patients experienced incomplete reduction after traction, and 9 had reducible CAAD (RAAD). The images (CT scans of the craniovertebral junction in a neutral position) obtained in the parasagittal, axial, and coronal planes were studied with respect to the C1-2 facets and were compared with 32 control scans. The inferior sagittal and coronal C-1 facet angles were measured. The lordosis of the cervical spine (cervical spine angle calculated on radiographs of the cervical spine, neutral view) in these patients was compared with normal. The management of these patients is described. RESULTS: The inferior sagittal C-1 facet angle and at least one coronal angle in patients with IrAAD were significantly acute compared with those in patients with RAAD and the control population. A significant correlation was found between age and the acuteness of the inferior sagittal C-1 facet angle (that is, the more acute the angle, the earlier the presentation). The lordosis of the cervical spine was exaggerated in patients with IrAAD. Three patients with IrAAD who had smaller acute angles experienced a partial reduction after traction and a complete reduction after intraoperative distraction of the facets, thereby avoiding a transoral procedure. An inferior sagittal C-1 facet angle of more than 150\textdegree{} in the sagittal plane predicted reducibility. Drilling a wedge off the facet in the sagittal plane to make the inferior sagittal C-1 facet angle 150\textdegree{} can reduce the C1-2 joint intraoperatively by posterior approach alone. CONCLUSIONS: The acuteness of the inferior C-1 sagittal facet angles possibly determines the age at presentation and reducibility. The coronal angles determine the telescoping of C-2 within C-1. Patients with IrAAD can be treated using a posterior approach alone with the exception of those with extremely acute angles or a retroflexed dens. The exaggerated lordosis of the cervical spine in these patients is a compensatory phenomenon.},

The current management strategies for irreducible AAD are directed at removing the cause of irreducibility followed by fusion, rather than transoral decompression and posterior fusion. The technique described in this paper addresses C1-2 facet mobilization by facetectomies to aid intraoperative manipulation. METHODS: Using this technique, reduction was achieved in 19 patients with congenital irreducible AAD treated between January 2011 and December 2013. The C1-2 joints were studied preoperatively, and particular attention was paid to the facet orientation. Intraoperatively, oblique C1-2 joints were opened widely, and extensive drilling of the facets was performed to make them close to flat and parallel to each other, converting an irreducible AAD to a reducible one. Anomalous vertebral arteries (VAs) were addressed appropriately. Further reduction was then achieved after vertical distraction and joint manipulation. RESULTS: Adequate facet drilling was achieved in all but 2 patients, due to VA injury in 1 patient and an acute sagittal angle operated on 2 years previously in the other patient. Complete reduction could be achieved in 17 patients and partial in the remaining 2. All patients showed clinical improvement. Two patients showed partial redislocation due to graft subsidence. The fusion rates were excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive drilling of the C1-2 facets appears to be a logical and effective technique for achieving direct posterior reduction in irreducible AAD. The extensive drilling makes large surfaces raw, increasing fusion rates.},

Of these, 45\% presented with associated syringes. A syrinx was more likely to be found above (49\%) than below (11\%) the tumor level. In 40\%, a syrinx could be identified above and below the tumor level. Ependymomas and hemangioblastomas were the most common tumor types to be associated with syringes. Astrocytomas tended to demonstrate syringes less often. Regardless of histology, the higher the spinal level, the more likely a syrinx was encountered. In general, the presence of an associated syrinx favored the resectability of the tumor, because it indicated a displacing rather than an infiltrating tumor. Patients with syringomyelia tended to recover from surgery sooner. However, surgical results and long-term prognosis were not influenced significantly by an associated syrinx. The most important factor determining long-term outcome was the preoperative level of neurological function. We propose that factors independent of the tumor, disturbances of cerebrospinal fluid and extracellular fluid flow in particular, have major roles in the pathogenesis of syrinx formation associated with intramedullary tumors.},

The incision is 1 to 2 cm above the clavicle, 1 cm lateral to the midline, and 5 to 7 cm long. Subplatysmal skin flaps are created. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is mobilized on its lateral edge and retracted but not divided. The scalene fat pad is split vertically, the omohyoid muscle excised, and the C5 nerve root dissected free. The accessory phrenic nerve is identified, if present, arising medially from C5, and preserved. The rest of the plexus is dissected free, muscular and connective tissue removed from all nerve roots and trunks, and the subclavian artery identified. The phrenic nerve is identified on the medial edge of the anterior scalene muscle (ASM). The ASM is divided on the first rib. The ASM is elevated, freed, and divided as high as possible and free of C5. The middle scalene muscle is dissected. C5 and C6 branches of the long thoracic nerve are identified and protected as the portion of middle scalene muscle adjacent to the nerves of the plexus is excised. The decision on whether the first rib is to be removed is determined by whether the lower trunk of the plexus is touching the first rib. If the rib is removed, its posterior end is freed, divided, and 1 cm excised. The rest of the rib is freed from the intercostal muscles with a periosteal elevator or harmonic scalpel, the pleura is separated from the inner surface of the rib, and the anterior end divided with an infraclavicular rib cutter. The operation has been made safer by identifying and dissecting the C5 nerve root before looking for the phrenic nerve.},

A new technique of continuous intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) that allows for real-time intraoperative feedback has recently been used for thyroid and cervical spine surgeries but has not previously been used in vagal schwannoma surgery. METHODS: Case series of three patients who underwent vagal schwannoma excision utilizing this novel IONM technique. The recurrent laryngeal and vagus nerves were monitored via the laryngeal adductor reflex (LAR) using an electromyographic endotracheal tube. RESULTS: Three patients with suspected vagal schwannomas were treated surgically using the intracapsular enucleation approach with a combination of intermittent IONM and continuous IONM of the LAR. CONCLUSION: This combination of continuous and intermittent IONM can be used to preserve vagal laryngeal innervation and function and may represent the future standard of care for vagal schwannoma excision.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Far-out syndrome (FOS) is a rare incident caused by L5 nerve root entrapment in the far-out area, the L5-S1 extraforaminal area between the transverse process and the sacral ala. The purpose of this study is to disclose the middle-term surgical outcomes of microscopic posterior decompression in the far-out area (MPDFA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: From June 2008 to November 2010, eight patients with FOS (six men and two women, mean age 65.4 years) were treated with MPDFA. Their chief complaint was leg pain in the L5 nerve root distribution area. Nerve root impingements in the far-out area were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and selective radiculography. Indications for MPDFA were given when pain was uncontrollable with conservative treatments for more than 1 month. MPDFA was performed according to the following procedure: a 4-to-5-cm skin incision was made just above the far-out area. The far-out area was exposed using Wiltse's intermuscular approach. The nerve root was decompressed with partial resection of the transverse process and the sacral ala, and removal of the iliolumbar ligament. Surgical outcomes were evaluated at periodical examinations with the Japanese Orthopedic Score (JOA) and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of the leg pain. The mean follow-up period was 24.3 months (ranging from 12 to 40 months). RESULTS: All patients had reduced radicular leg pain after their operations. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 11.4 days, and the patients returned to their normal activities of daily living immediately after discharge. Both JOA and the VAS scores improved after surgery. The scores temporarily worsened in two patients with degenerative scoliosis; the worsening was attributed not to recurrence of the radiculopathy but to pain arising from knee arthropathy. The scores were maintained in the other patients at least until the final examinations during the follow-up. CONCLUSION: MPDFA is a less-invasive surgery for treating FOS and can provide a good middle-term surgical outcome.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension, optic nerve sheath fenestration or CSF shunting is considered the next line of management. Venous sinus stenosis has been increasingly recognized as a treatable cause of elevated intracranial pressure in a subset of patients. In this article, we present the results of the largest meta-analysis of optic nerve sheath fenestration, CSF shunting, and dural venous sinus stenting. This is the only article that compares these procedures, to our knowledge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a PubMed search of all peer-reviewed articles from 1988 to 2014 for patients who underwent a procedure for medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension. RESULTS: Optic nerve sheath fenestration analysis included 712 patients. Postprocedure, there was improvement of vision in 59\%, headache in 44\%, and papilledema in 80\%; 14.8\% of patients required a repeat procedure with major and minor complication rates of 1.5\% and 16.4\%, respectively. The CSF diversion procedure analysis included 435 patients. Postprocedure, there was improvement of vision in 54\%, headache in 80\%, and papilledema in 70\%; 43\% of patients required at least 1 additional surgery. The major and minor complication rates were 7.6\% and 32.9\%, respectively. The dural venous sinus stenting analysis included 136 patients. After intervention, there was improvement of vision in 78\%, headache in 83\%, and papilledema in 97\% of patients. The major and minor complication rates were 2.9\% and 4.4\%, respectively. Fourteen additional procedures were performed with a repeat procedure rate of 10.3\%. Three patients had contralateral stent placement, while 8 had ipsilateral stent placement within or adjacent to the original stent. Only 3 patients required conversion to CSF diversion or 2.2\% of patients with stents. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension have traditionally undergone a CSF diversion procedure as the first intervention. This paradigm may need to be re-examined, given the high technical and clinical success and low complication rates with dural venous sinus stenting.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous spinal CSF-venous fistulas are a distinct type of spinal CSF leak recently described in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). Using digital subtraction myelography (DSM) with the patient in the prone position, the authors have been able to demonstrate such fistulas in about one-fifth of patients with SIH in whom conventional spinal imaging (MRI or CT myelography) showed no evidence for a CSF leak (i.e., the presence of extradural CSF). The authors compared findings of DSM with patients in the lateral decubitus position versus the prone position and now report a significantly increased yield of identifying spinal CSF-venous fistulas with this modification of their imaging protocol. METHODS: The population consisted of 23 patients with SIH who underwent DSM in the lateral decubitus position and 26 patients with SIH who underwent DSM in the prone position. None of the patients had evidence of a CSF leak on conventional spinal imaging. RESULTS: A CSF-venous fistula was demonstrated in 17 (74\%) of the 23 patients who underwent DSM in the lateral decubitus position compared to 4 (15\%) of the 26 patients who underwent DSM in the prone position (p {$<$} 0.0001). The mean age of these 16 women and 5 men was 52.5 years (range 36-66 years). CONCLUSIONS: Among SIH patients in whom conventional spinal imaging showed no evidence of a CSF leak, DSM in the lateral decubitus position demonstrated a CSF-venous fistula in about three-fourths of patients compared to only 15\% of patients when the DSM was performed in the prone position, an approximately five-fold increase in the detection rate. Spinal CSF-venous fistulas are not rare among patients with SIH.},

In all twelve patients, posterolateral arthrodesis had been done bilaterally through a midline or paraspinal muscle-splitting approach.

An acute cauda equina syndrome that follows a seemingly uneventful in situ arthrodesis for spondylolisthesis is best treated by an immediate decompression that includes resection of the posterosuperior rim of the dome of the sacrum and the adjacent intervertebral disc.

OBJECTIVES: To clinically and radiographically study two populations of adult patients with either adolescent idiopathic scoliosis of the adult or de novo degenerative scoliosis in a quantitative manner to identify reliable radiographic parameters that correlate with clinical symptoms. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND: Although there are many causes of spinal deformity in the adult, there are two main categories of adult scoliosis: adolescent idiopathic scoliosis of the adult and de novo degenerative scoliosis. Unlike pediatric scoliosis, in adults there are no established radiographic parameters or classification systems that reliably provide a clinical correlation or offer a useful language for communication among specialists. This study gathered complete clinical and radiographic information on 95 patients with adult scoliosis and established several radiographic parameters that correlated with clinical symptoms. METHODS: Each of the 95 patients completed a clinical questionnaire that included a self-reported visual analog scale and underwent full-length standing anteroposterior and lateral radiography. Radiographic analysis was performed by use of digital analysis and included measurement of the Cobb angle, the number of vertebrae in each curve, plumbline offset from T1 to the midsacral line, the upper endplate obliquities of L3 and L4, and maximal lateral olisthy between two adjacent lumbar vertebrae. Sagittal plane measurements included lumbar lordosis, thoracolumbar kyphosis, and the Sagittal Pelvic Tilt Index. Statistical analysis of both radiographic and clinical parameters of pain was performed to determine any significant correlations between the two. RESULTS: This study showed that lateral vertebral olisthy, L3 and L4 endplate obliquity angles, lumbar lordosis, and thoracolumbar kyphosis were significantly correlated with pain. CONCLUSION: This quantitative analysis identified several clinically relevant radiographic parameters in adult scoliosis patients. Additionally, excellent predictive formulas for self-reported pain levels were obtained.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective self-assessment analysis of a consecutive series of adult patients diagnosed with adult scoliosis of adolescent onset or de novo degenerative scoliosis. PURPOSE: To analyze the impact that scoliosis has on patient health perceptions. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There exists little data studying the effect scoliosis has on an adult's self-perception of health. METHODS: Inclusion criteria were: age {$>$} or =18 years, Cobb angle greater than 10 degrees, degenerative or idiopathic deformity, no prior surgery (spine), and complete records. Each patient completed the standard Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. For each patient, radiographic and clinical data were evaluated. After all data were collected, the mean, standard deviation (SD), and true N values of the Cobb angle were calculated. This study population was then divided into two groups: patients with a Cobb angle greater than 10 degrees and patients with a Cobb angle greater than 20 degrees. Comparison of the SF-36 data for adult scoliosis patients with the United States general population, the United States general population ages 55-64, and patients with hypertension and low back pain was undertaken. RESULTS: The mean age for the patients in this study was 63 years of age; 22 patients were diagnosed as having adult scoliosis of adolescent onset and 27 patients had de novo degenerative scoliosis. The Cobb angle in this study group was found to be greater than 20 degrees in 41 patients; of these patients, 19 patients had a diagnosis of adult scoliosis of adolescent onset and 22 patients had a diagnosis of de novo degenerative scoliosis. Taken as a whole, the patients in this study averaged scores much lower than the norms for both the general U.S. population in all 8 categories and the U.S. population for ages 55 to 64 in 7 out of 8 categories of the SF-36 questionnaire. Additionally, patients with scoliosis also showed lower scores compared to that of the norms found of patients with comorbid conditions: back pain/sciatica with hypertension in seven of the eight categories: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health. Of the radiographic parameters analyzed, loss of lumbar lordosis revealed a significant correlation with social function: P = 0.018; role emotional: P = 0.038; and overall general health: P = 0.05. The other radiographic parameters did not reveal statistically significant correlation to the calculated SF-36 scores. CONCLUSION: Our data clearly demonstrate the impact that adult scoliosis has on a patient's perception of health. The severity of this impact is strikingly apparent in the SF-36 scores when compared to benchmark data on patients with comorbid conditions such as back pain and hypertension. It is our conclusion that adult scoliosis is becoming a medical condition of significant impact, affecting the fastest growing section of our society to a previously unrecognized degree.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective consecutive clinical review of 98 patients. OBJECTIVE: To create a preliminary approach to a clinically important classification of scoliosis in adult patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is currently no accepted classification of scoliosis in adults. High prevalence rates of scoliosis in the elderly and recent studies of health impact support the need for a clinically relevant classification. METHODS: A total of 98 adult patients with scoliosis with a 2-year minimum treatment/follow-up were included. Patients were classified into one of 3 types of deformity based on the degree of lordosis (L1-S1) and frontal plane endplate obliquity of L3 on standing radiographs: type I = lordosis {$>$} 55 degrees, L3 obliquity {$<$} 15 degrees; type II = lordosis 35 degrees-55 degrees, L3 obliquity 15 degrees-25 degrees; and type III = lordosis {$<$} 35 degrees, L3 obliquity {$>$} 25 degrees. RESULTS: Curve patterns included thoracic, thoracolumbar, lumbar, thoracic, and lumbar (mean Cobb angle 30 degrees, standard deviation 19 degrees). Cobb angle revealed no correlation to visual analog pain score (VAS) or general health (36-Item Short-Form Health Survey). Significant correlation between endplate obliquity L3, L1-S1 lordosis and VAS was noted (P {$<$} 0.05). Mean pain scores of classified patients were: type I, VAS = 27.7; type II, VAS = 43.3; and type III, VAS = 47.1 (type I vs. III, P {$<$} 0.05). Surgical rates (failed minimum 3-month conservative care, including bracing, physical therapy, and pharmacological treatment) by group were: type I, 0\%; type II, 9\%; and type III, 22.7\% (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: A simple classification of adult scoliosis was developed based on frontal and sagittal plane standing radiographs. With increasing type (from I to III), self-reported pain and disability increased. This result was reflected in the treatment approach as well, with surgical rates increasing from types I to III. Further refinement is important to develop an all inclusive and sufficiently descriptive system.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: prospective, multicenter. OBJECTIVE: To determine if models for predicting outcome and complications in the setting of adult deformity surgery can be constructed. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A classification of adult spinal deformity has been established. The latter categorizes patients radiographically and ties to disability as well as most likely treatment approach. Classification by radiographs alone is insufficient to guide treatment and models for predicting outcome are necessary to establish algorithms. METHODS: This is a longitudinal study of adult patients with spinal deformity. All subjects were drawn from a prospective multicenter database. Baseline, 1-year and 2-year radiographic and health related quality of life measures were obtained (SRS, ODI, SF-12). Any peri- or postoperative complications were tabulated. Binary and logistic regressions were applied to create models of outcome and complications. RESULTS: Predictive models of reaching a minimal clinically important difference had an area under the ROC curve above 0.82 and correct classification from 75\% to 81\%. Development of a complication was correctly classified in 71\% of cases. Patients most likely to reach threshold improvement through surgery: older, lower apex deformity, greater disability, higher deformity score by classification. Patients most likely to develop complications: high sagittal balance grade and fusion to sacrum. CONCLUSION: By applying the classification of adult deformity and considering baseline health status, models for predicting outcome can be established. Further work will refine these models and permit clinical validation. This effort will help establish reliable clinical models such that treatment algorithms can be established for the challenging patients suffering from adult spinal deformity.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Research update, focused review. OBJECTIVE: Identify the role of the pelvis in the setting of adults with spinal deformity. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Sagittal plane alignment is increasingly recognized as a critical parameter in the setting of adult spinal deformity. Additionally, pelvic parameters reveal to be a key component in the regulation of sagittal alignment. METHODS: Analysis of the pelvis in the sagittal plane is commonly assessed by 3 angular measurements: the pelvic incidence (morphologic parameter directly linked to sagittal morphotypes), the pelvic tilt (or pelvis retroversion used to maintain an upright posture in the setting of spinal deformity), and the sacral slope. Recent work using force plate technology has revealed that in the setting of anterior trunk inclination ("spinal imbalance"), the pelvis shifted posteriorly (toward the heels) in order to maintain a balanced mass distribution. The complex relationship between pelvic and spinal parameter were investigated in order to construct predictive formulas of postoperative spinopelvic alignment. It has emerged that pelvic tilt is highly correlated with patient self reported function (ODI, SF-12, and SRS). CONCLUSION: It has become evident that good clinical outcome in the treatment of spinal deformity requires proper alignment. Pelvis parameters play an essential role not only in terms of spine morphotypes but also in regulating standing balance and postoperative alignment. Thus, optimal treatment of a patient with spinal deformity requires integration of the pelvis in the preoperative evaluation and treatment plan.},

OBJECTIVE: Outline the basic principles in the evaluation and treatment of adult spinal deformity patients with a focus on goals to achieve during surgical realignment surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Proper global alignment of the spine is critical in maintaining standing posture and balance in an efficient and pain-free manner. Outcomes data demonstrate the clinical effect of spinopelvic malalignment and form a basis for realignment strategies. METHODS: Correlation between certain radiographic parameters and patient self-reported pain and disability has been established. Using normative values for several important spinopelvic parameters (including sagittal vertical axis, pelvic tilt, and lumbar lordosis), spinopelvic radiographic realignment objectives were identified as a tool for clinical application. Because of the complex relationship between the spine and the pelvis in maintaining posture and the wide range of "normal" values for the associated parameters, a focus on global alignment, with proportionality of individual parameters to each other, was pursued to provide clinical relevance to planning realignment for deformity across a range of clinical cases. CONCLUSION: Good clinical outcome requires achieving proper spinopelvic alignment in the treatment of adult spinal deformity. Although variations in pelvic morphology exist, a framework has been established to determine ideal values for regional and global parameter in an individualized patient approach. When planning realignment surgery for adult spinal deformity, restoring low sagittal vertical axis and pelvic tilt values are critical goals, and should be combined with proportional lumbar lordosis to pelvic incidence.},

Although pediatric scoliosis classifications are well established, an ASD classification is still being developed. A previous classification developed by Schwab et al has met with clinical relevance but did not include pelvic parameters, which have shown substantial correlation with health-related quality of life measures in recent studies. METHODS: Initiated by the Scoliosis Research Society Adult Deformity Committee, this study revised a previously published classification to include pelvic parameters. Modifier cutoffs were determined using health-related quality of life analysis from a multicenter database of adult deformity patients. Nine readers graded 21 premarked cases twice each, approximately 1 week apart. Inter- and intra-rater variability and agreement were determined for curve type and each modifier separately.

RESULTS: Inter-rater kappa for curve type was 0.80 and 0.87 for the 2 readings, respectively, with modifier kappas of 0.75 and 0.86, 0.97 and 0.98, and 0.96 and 0.96 for pelvic incidence minus lumbar lordosis (PI-LL), pelvic tilt (PT), and sagittal vertical axis (SVA), respectively. By the second reading, curve type was identified by all readers consistently in 66.7\%, PI-LL in 71.4\%, PT in 95.2\%, and SVA in 90.5\% of cases. Intra-rater kappa averaged 0.94 for curve type, 0.88 for PI-LL, 0.97 for PT, and 0.97 for SVA across all readers.

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Prospective multicenter study evaluating operative (OP) versus nonoperative (NONOP) treatment for adult spinal deformity (ASD). OBJECTIVE: Evaluate correlations between spinopelvic parameters and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores in patients with ASD. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Sagittal spinal deformity is commonly defined by an increased sagittal vertical axis (SVA); however, SVA alone may underestimate the severity of the deformity. Spinopelvic parameters provide a more complete assessment of the sagittal plane but only limited data are available that correlate spinopelvic parameters with disability. METHODS.: Baseline demographic, radiographical, and HRQOL data were obtained for all patients enrolled in a multicenter consecutive database. Inclusion criteria were: age more than 18 years and radiographical diagnosis of ASD. Radiographical evaluation was conducted on the frontal and lateral planes and HRQOL questionnaires (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI], Scoliosis Research Society-22r and Short Form [SF]-12) were completed. Radiographical parameters demonstrating highest correlation with HRQOL values were evaluated to determine thresholds predictive of ODI more than 40. RESULTS: Four hundred ninety-two consecutive patients with ASD (mean age, 51.9 yr) were enrolled. Patients from the OP group (n = 178) were older (55 vs. 50.1 yr, P {$<$} 0.05), had greater SVA (5.5 vs. 1.7 cm, P {$<$} 0.05), greater pelvic tilt (PT; 22\textdegree{} vs. 11\textdegree, P {$<$} 0.05), and greater pelvic incidence/lumbar lordosis PI/LL mismatch (PI-LL; 12.2 vs. 4.3; P {$<$} 0.05) than NONOP group (n = 314). OP group demonstrated greater disability on all HRQOL measures compared with NONOP group (ODI = 41.4 vs. 23.9, P {$<$} 0.05; Scoliosis Research Society score total = 2.9 vs. 3.5, P {$<$} 0.05). Pearson analysis demonstrated that among all parameters, PT, SVA, and PI-LL correlated most strongly with disability for both OP and NONOP groups (P {$<$} 0.001). Linear regression models demonstrated threshold radiographical spinopelvic parameters for ODI more than 40 to be: PT 22\textdegree{} or more (r = 0.38), SVA 47 mm or more (r = 0.47), PI - LL 11\textdegree{} or more (r = 0.45). CONCLUSION: ASD is a disabling condition. Prospective analysis of consecutively enrolled patients with ASD demonstrated that PT and PI-LL combined with SVA can predict patient disability and provide a guide for patient assessment for appropriate therapeutic decision making. Threshold values for severe disability (ODI {$>$} 40) included: PT 22\textdegree{} or more, SVA 47 mm or more, and PI - LL 11\textdegree{} or more.},

Many of these tumors are located ventral or ventrolateral to the spinal cord and medulla. Posterior approaches, although adequate for the management of most of these tumors, can sometimes result in incomplete removal of the tumor and exacerbation of the neurological deficits. Although the transoral and transcervical approaches provide a direct route to the tumor, the exposure of the lateral margins in the case of large tumors is inadequate. In addition, because of the removal of vertebral bodies, subsequent fusion may be necessary. In the present report, an extreme lateral approach to the foramen magnum and cervical spine for the removal of intradural tumors is described. The approach provides a lateral exposure of the tumor-cord/stem interface, thus permitting safe dissection without retraction of the cord. The entire longitudinal and lateral extent of the tumor and also its extradural extension can be can be managed by this approach. This approach can be considered in such a group of patients harboring entirely ventral or recurrent tumors for which the conventional posterior approach has failed. Six patients who underwent this procedure are described to illustrate its application.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Multilevel anterior cervical decompressive surgery and fusion effectively treats cervical myeloradiculopathy that is caused by severe cervical spinal stenosis, but degenerative changes at adjacent vertebral levels frequently result in long-term morbidity. The authors performed a modified open-door laminoplasty procedure in which allograft bone and titanium miniplates were used to treat cervical myeloradiculopathy in younger patients with congenital canal stenosis while maintaining functional cervical motion segments. Pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging and/or computerized tomography myelography were performed to assess changes in cervical spinal canal dimensions. Pre- and postoperative flexion-extension radiographs were compared to determine the residual motion of the targeted operative segments. METHODS: Twenty younger patients (average age 37.7 years) underwent modified open-door laminoplasty for treatment of myelopathy or myeloradiculopathy related to significant cervical spinal stenosis with or without associated central or lateral disc herniation or foraminal stenosis. These surgeries were performed during a 2-year period and follow-up review remains ongoing (average follow-up period 21.6 months). Reconstructive procedures were performed on an average of 4.1 levels (range three-six). Operative time averaged 186 minutes (range 93-229 minutes). Average blood loss was 305 ml (range 100-650 ml). No cases were complicated by neurological deterioration, infection, wound breakdown, graft displacement, or hardware failure. The patients' Nurick Scale grade improved from a preoperative average of 1.8 to a postoperative average of 0.5. Pre- and postoperative sagittal spinal diameter averaged 11.2 mm (8-14 mm) and 16.6 mm (13-19 mm), respectively. The sagittal compression ratio (sagittal/lateral x 100\%) increased from 48\% pre- to 72\% postoperatively. The spinal canal area increased an average of 55\% (range 19-127\%). In patients in whom pre- and postoperative flexion-extension radiographs were obtained, 72.7\% residual neck motion was maintained. No patient developed increased neck or shoulder pain. Neurological symptoms improved in all patients, with total relief of myelopathy in 50\% and partial improvement in 50\%. CONCLUSIONS: Modified open-door laminoplasty with allograft bone and titanium miniplates effectively treats neurological deficits in younger patients with congenital and spinal stenosis. Although long-term results are unknown, short-term results are good and there is a low incidence of complications.},

Hitherto, unexplored is the relevance of cervical deformity to the pathophysiology of such neurological disability, and whether correction of that deformity should be a surgical objective when planning for reconstruction after spinal cord decompression. Such correction could address both the static cord compression and the dynamic repetitive cord injury, while also restoring more normal biomechanics to the cervical spine. The articles in this focus issue's section on cervical spinal deformity reveal that cervical sagittal alignment is geometrically related to thoracolumbar spinal pelvic alignment and to T1 slope, and that it is further clinically correlated to regional disability and general health scores and to myelopathy severity. These conclusions are based on narrative reviews and a selection of primary research data, reflecting the nascency of this field. They further recommend for preoperative assessment of spinal alignment when significant deformity is suspected, and that correction of cervical kyphosis should be an objective when surgery is planned.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Assessment of the motion of the cerebellar tonsils is of interest in diseases affecting the CSF flow at the foramen magnum. Cardiac-gated balanced steady-state free-precession technique, which has recently been shown to demonstrate the pulsatile motion of neural structures, appears well suited to allow direct measurement of craniocaudal translation of cerebellar tonsils during the cardiac cycle. Our aim was to assess the intra-observer and inter-observer variability in the assessment of tonsillar motion utilizing this technique. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 44 patients who had undergone MR imaging with cine TrueFISP sequence, as a part of CSF flow study. Two neuroradiologists independently assessed the images. The tonsillar pulsatility was subjectively characterized into none, minimal, and marked categories after review of the images on a cine loop. For patients with identifiable tonsillar motion, the maximal extent of translation of the inferior edge of the cerebellar tonsil was directly measured. Both readers repeated the measurements after a minimum interval of 2~weeks. Intra- and inter-observer variability was characterized by calculating the kappa statistics. RESULTS: The intra-observer agreement for subjective assessment of tonsillar pulsatility was near perfect while the inter-observer agreement was substantial. A good intra- and inter-observer correlation was also seen for the objective measurements of the tonsillar motion. A good correlation was found between the subjective categorization of the tonsillar pulsatility and the objective measurements. CONCLUSION: Steady-state balanced free-precession MR imaging technique allows for a reproducible subjective and objective assessment of tonsillar pulsatility.},

  abstract = {Syringomyelia, at its core, is a disorder of an abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation. A syrinx is a fluid-filled~cavity that anatomically lies within the spinal cord parenchyma or the central canal[1]. This entity is most frequently associated with a CM-I,[2] although other known causes include spinal cord tumor, trauma, and post-traumatic or infectious adhesive arachnoiditis.[3][4]~Although syringomyelia predominantly presents with sensory symptoms such as pain and temperature insensitivity, in most cases it is an incidental finding.[1][5]. The discovery of syringomyelia is becoming more common because of the increased use of~MRI in the routine evaluation of back and neck pain.[5] The natural history of patients with syringomyelia is variable and unpredictable punctuated with periods of stability and progression. Although professionals do not completely understand the natural history of syringomyelia, the clinical course progresses over months to years, with an~early~rapid deterioration that gradually slows down.[6]~It~is also understood that sudden jolting of the head, a prolonged bout of coughing may bring a sudden onset of symptoms in a previously asymptomatic patient presumably because of~an increase in tonsillar descent.[2][7] Syringomyelia accounts for up to 5\% of paraplegias.[8]~The quality of life in syringomyelia patients is comparable with that of patients with heart failure or malignant neoplasms.[9]},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is usually caused by a spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. CSF-venous fistula is an underdiagnosed cause of spinal CSF leak, as it is challenging to identify on myelography. OBJECTIVE: To review existing literature to summarize common presentations, diagnostic imaging modalities, and current treatment strategies for CSF-venous fistulas. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases to identify studies discussing CSF-venous fistulas. Titles and abstracts were screened. Studies meeting prespecified inclusion criteria were reviewed in full. RESULTS: Of 180 articles identified, 16 articles met inclusion criteria. Individual patient data was acquired from 7 studies reporting on 18 patients. CSF-venous fistula most frequently presented as positional headache. Digital subtraction myelography provided greatest detection of CSF-venous fistula in the lateral decubitus position and detected CSF-venous fistula in all individual patient cases. Dynamic computed tomography (CT) myelogram enabled detection and differentiation of CSF-venous fistulas from low-flow epidural leaks. The majority of fistulas were in the thoracic spine and slightly more common on the right. Epidural blood patch (EBP) provided temporary or no relief in all individual patients. Resolution or improvement of clinical symptoms and radiologic normalization were observed in all surgically treated patients. CONCLUSION: Although rare, CSF-venous fistula is an important cause of spinal CSF leak contributing to SIH. Dynamic CT myelogram and digital subtraction myelography, particularly in the lateral decubitus position, are the most accurate and effective diagnostic imaging modalities. EBPs often provide only transient relief, while surgical management is preferred.},

OBJECTIVE.: To study the results of distraction reduction of high-grade isthmic dysplastic spondylolisthesis with posterior lumbar interbody fusion and posterior compression in a consecutive, prospectively collected series of adolescent patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: High-grade isthmic dysplastic spondylolisthesis has been associated with a high complication and failure rate regardless of the method of surgical treatment, including in situ fusion, cast correction and fusion, anterior fusion, posterior instrumented fusion, and combination procedures. METHODS: A total of 18 adolescents with the diagnosis and a minimum 50\% slip underwent the procedure of Gill decompression, temporary distraction with reduction of the deformity, complete lumbosacral discectomy, posterior lumbar interbody fusion with Harm's cage and autogenous iliac graft, and posterior monosegmental compression instrumentation with pedicular fixation. RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 2.3 to 5 years. Slip improved from 77\% to 13\% and slip angle from 35 degrees to 3.8 degrees initially and 4.3 degrees at final follow-up. One patient had loss of 16 degrees of slip angle but achieved arthrodesis. Sacral inclination improved from 28 degrees to 39 degrees . There were no neurologic or infectious complications. There were no overt instrumentation failures. Arthrodesis was achieved in every instance. Two patients had structural complications, neither of which underwent reoperation. CONCLUSIONS: The index procedure provided near-anatomic correction of high-grade spondylolisthesis, which is maintained at a minimum 2-year follow-up without significant complications. There were two structural complications. Anterior column structural support and posterior compressive instrumentation help restore the necessary biomechanics to allow clinical fusion and success. This series has led the senior author to evolve his technique too ften include caudad fixation to the pelvis and/or cephalad fixation to L4.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Lumbar foraminal stenosis is a common clinical problem and a significant cause of lower extremity radiculopathy. Minimal in~vivo data exists quantifying changes in foraminal area (FA) as the spine moves from flexion to extension in the lumbar spine or on the relationship between FA and lumbar segmental angular motion, translational motion (TM), or disc bulge migration. PURPOSE: To use kinetic magnetic resonance imaging (kMRI) to evaluate changes in dimensions of lumbar neural foramina during weight bearing in neutral, flexion, and extension positions. To evaluate the relationship between foraminal stenosis and lumbar segmental angular motion, TM, and disc bulge migration. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective radiographic study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Forty-five patients with a mean age of 44 years undergoing kMRI for symptoms of low back pain or radiculopathy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Magnetic resonance imaging measurements of FA, angular motion, TM, and disc bulge migration. METHODS: Kinetic magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine was reviewed in 45 patients with low back pain or radiculopathy, and parasagittal images were evaluated for changes in neural foraminal dimensions in various degrees of motion with weight bearing. The changes in foraminal dimension were correlated to the amount of segmental angular motion, TM, and disc bulge migration at each level. Neural foramina were also assessed qualitatively by Wildermuth criteria. Only those foramina that were clearly visualized with well-defined anatomic boundaries in all three positions were taken into consideration. Patients with previous surgery, tumor, and scoliosis were excluded from the study. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the FA from flexion to neutral (p{$<$}.05) at all levels except L5-S1 and from neutral to extension at all levels (p{$<$}.05). The average percent decrease in FA was 30.0\% with the greatest decrease from flexion to extension occurring at L2-L3 (167-107 mm(2)) and the smallest change occurring at L5-S1 (135-106 mm(2)) (p{$<$}.05). The magnitude of change in FA increased as angular motion at a segment increased. The mean change in FA was 32.3 mm(2) when angular motion was less than 5\textdegree{} and was 75.16 mm(2) when angular motion exceeded 15\textdegree. The extent of disc bulging posteriorly in the neural foramen was also correlated with the reduction in the FA from flexion to extension, but TM had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: Foraminal area decreased significantly in extension compared with flexion and neutral on MRI. Lumbar disc bulge migration and angular motion at each level contributed independently to the decrease in FA in extension, whereas TM had no effect on FA.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: To improve results of surgical treatment of ventral and ventrolateral tumors of the spinal cord, the authors analyzed surgical approaches, defined the indications for various approaches, and assessed the clinical results. METHODS: Between 1993 and 2004 the authors treated 360 patients: 43 of them had dorsal, 177 dorsolateral, 33 ventral, and 107 had ventrolateral intradural extramedullary tumors. Among 140 patients with intradural extramedullary ventral and ventrolateral tumors, neuromas were seen in 56 and meningiomas in 84. Of the 140 patients studied, tumors were removed totally in 102 (74\%), subtotally in 30 (21\%), and partially in eight (5\%). After ventrolateral and dorsolateral approaches were introduced in 1996, tumors in ventral or ventrolateral locations have been removed totally or subtotally. In the group of patients with meningiomas, 41 of the lesions were the meningothelial type, 22 were transitional, 12 fibroblastic, four psammomatous, three were angiomatous, one was atypical, and one was malignant. Tumors in the neuroma group were schwannomas in 45 patients and neurofibromas in 11. Postoperatively, recovery was observed in 70 patients (50\%), improvement in 53 (38\%), no change in 10 (7\%), and deterioration in seven (5\%). At follow-up evaluation recovery was noted in 76 patients, improvement in 58, no change in four, and in two patients the neurological symptoms were worse than before the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical routes to extramedullary tumors should be chosen based on the location of the tumor, its spread, and the region in which it is localized.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of prospectively collected data. OBJECTIVE: Development of methods to determine in vivo spinal cord dimensions and application to correlate preoperative alignment, myelopathy, and health-related quality-of-life scores in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: CSM is the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction. The association between cervical alignment, sagittal balance, and myelopathy has not been well characterized. METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of the prospective, multicenter AOSpine North America CSM study. Inclusion criteria for this study required preoperative cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neutral sagittal cervical radiography. Techniques for MRI assessment of spinal cord dimensions were developed. Correlations between imaging and health-related quality-of-life scores were assessed. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients met inclusion criteria (mean age = 55.4 yr). The modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) scores correlated with C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA) (r = -0.282, P = 0.035). Spinal cord volume correlated with cord length (r = 0.472, P {$<$} 0.001) and cord average cross-sectional area (r = 0.957, P {$<$} 0.001). For all patients, no correlations were found between MRI measurements of spinal cord length, volume, mean cross-sectional area or surface area, and outcomes. For patients with cervical lordosis, mJOA scores correlated positively with cord volume (r = 0.366, P = 0.022), external cord area (r = 0.399, P = 0.012), and mean cross-sectional cord area (r = 0.345, P = 0.031). In contrast, for patients with cervical kyphosis, mJOA scores correlated negatively with cord volume (r = -0.496, P = 0.043) and mean cross-sectional cord area (r = -0.535, P = 0.027). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to correlate cervical sagittal balance (C2-C7 SVA) to myelopathy severity. We found a moderate negative correlation in kyphotic patients of cord volume and cross-sectional area to mJOA scores. The opposite (positive correlation) was found for lordotic patients, suggesting a relationship of cord volume to myelopathy that differs on the basis of sagittal alignment. It is interesting to note that sagittal balance but not kyphosis is tied to myelopathy score. Future work will correlate alignment changes to cord morphology changes and myelopathy outcomes. SUMMARY STATEMENTS: This is the first study to correlate sagittal balance (C2-C7 SVA) to myelopathy severity. We found a moderate negative correlation in kyphotic patients of cord volume and cross-sectional area to mJOA scores. The opposite (positive correlation) was found for lordotic patients, suggesting a relationship of cord volume to myelopathy that differs on the basis of sagittal alignment.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Increased sagittal vertical axis (SVA) correlates strongly with pain and disability for adults with spinal deformity. A subset of patients with sagittal spinopelvic malalignment (SSM) have flatback deformity (pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis [PI-LL] mismatch {$>$} 10\textdegree ) but remain sagittally compensated with normal SVA. Few data exist for SSM patients with flatback deformity and normal SVA. The authors' objective was to compare baseline disability and treatment outcomes for patients with compensated (SVA {$<$} 5 cm and PI-LL mismatch {$>$} 10\textdegree ) and decompensated (SVA {$>$} 5 cm) SSM. METHODS: The study was a multicenter, prospective analysis of adults with spinal deformity who consecutively underwent surgical treatment for SSM. Inclusion criteria included age older than 18 years, presence of adult spinal deformity with SSM, plan for surgical treatment, and minimum 1-year follow-up data. Patients with SSM were divided into 2 groups: those with compensated SSM (SVA {$<$} 5 cm and PI-LL mismatch {$>$} 10\textdegree ) and those with decompensated SSM (SVA {$\geq$} 5 cm). Baseline and 1-year follow-up radiographic and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes included Oswestry Disability Index, Short Form-36 scores, and Scoliosis Research Society-22 scores. Percentages of patients achieving minimal clinically important difference (MCID) were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 125 patients (27 compensated and 98 decompensated) met inclusion criteria. Compared with patients in the compensated group, patients in the decompensated group were older (62.9 vs. 55.1 years; p = 0.004) and had less scoliosis (43\textdegree{} vs 54\textdegree; p = 0.002), greater SVA (12.0 cm vs. 1.7 cm; p {$<$} 0.001), greater PI-LL mismatch (26\textdegree{} vs. 20\textdegree; p = 0.013), and poorer HRQOL scores (Oswestry Disability Index, Short Form-36 physical component score, Scoliosis Research Society-22 total; p {$\leq$} 0.016). Although these baseline HRQOL differences between the groups reached statistical significance, only the mean difference in Short Form-36 physical component score reached threshold for MCID. Compared with baseline assessment, at 1 year after surgery improvement was noted for patients in both groups for mean SVA (compensated -1.1 cm, decompensated +4.8 cm; p {$\leq$} 0.009), mean PI-LL mismatch (compensated 6\textdegree, decompensated 5\textdegree; p {$<$} 0.001), and all HRQOL measures assessed (p {$\leq$} 0.005). No significant differences were found between the compensated and decompensated groups in the magnitude of HRQOL score improvement or in the percentages of patients achieving MCID for each of the outcome measures assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Decompensated SSM patients with elevated SVA experience significant disability; however, the amount of disability in compensated SSM patients with flatback deformity caused by PI-LL mismatch but normal SVA is underappreciated. Surgical correction of SSM demonstrated similar radiographic and HRQOL score improvements for patients in both groups. Evaluation of SSM should extend beyond measuring SVA. Among patients with concordant pain and disability, PI-LL mismatch must be evaluated for SSM patients and can be considered a primary indication for surgery.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Although multiple reports have documented significant benefit from surgical treatment of adult spinal deformity (ASD), these procedures can have high complication rates. Previously reported complications rates associated with ASD surgery are limited by retrospective design, single-surgeon or single-center cohorts, lack of rigorous data on complications, and/or limited follow-up. Accurate definition of complications associated with ASD surgery is important and may serve as a resource for patient counseling and efforts to improve the safety of patient care. The authors conducted a study to prospectively assess the rates of complications associated with ASD surgery with a minimum 2-year follow-up based on a multicenter study design that incorporated standardized data-collection forms, on-site study coordinators, and regular auditing of data to help ensure complete and accurate reporting of complications. In addition, they report age stratification of complication rates and provide a general assessment of factors that may be associated with the occurrence of complications. METHODS As part of a prospective, multicenter ASD database, standardized forms were used to collect data on surgery-related complications. On-site coordinators and central auditing helped ensure complete capture of complication data. Inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years, ASD, and plan for operative treatment. Complications were classified as perioperative (within 6 weeks of surgery) or delayed (between 6 weeks after surgery and time of last follow-up), and as minor or major. The primary focus for analyses was on patients who reached a minimum follow-up of 2 years. RESULTS Of 346 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 291 (84\%) had a minimum 2-year follow-up (mean 2.1 years); their mean age was 56.2 years. The vast majority (99\%) had treatment including a posterior procedure, 25\% had an anterior procedure, and 19\% had a 3-column osteotomy. At least 1 revision was required in 82 patients (28.2\%). A total of 270 perioperative complications (145 minor; 125 major) were reported, with 152 patients (52.2\%) affected, and a total of 199 delayed complications (62 minor; 137 major) were reported, with 124 patients (42.6\%) affected. Overall, 469 complications (207 minor; 262 major) were documented, with 203 patients (69.8\%) affected. The most common complication categories included implant related, radiographic, neurological, operative, cardiopulmonary, and infection. Higher complication rates were associated with older age (p = 0.009), greater body mass index (p {$\leq$} 0.031), increased comorbidities (p {$\leq$} 0.007), previous spine fusion (p = 0.029), and 3-column osteotomies (p = 0.036). Cases in which 2-year follow-up was not achieved included 2 perioperative mortalities (pulmonary embolus and inferior vena cava injury). CONCLUSIONS This study provides an assessment of complications associated with ASD surgery based on a prospective, multicenter design and with a minimum 2-year follow-up. Although the overall complication rates were high, in interpreting these findings, it is important to recognize that not all complications are equally impactful. This study represents one of the most complete and detailed reports of perioperative and delayed complications associated with ASD surgery to date. These findings may prove useful for treatment planning, patient counseling, benchmarking of complication rates, and efforts to improve the safety and cost-effectiveness of patient care.},

We calculated the average annual rupture rate of small unruptured aneurysms and also investigated risk factors that contribute to rupture and enlargement of these aneurysms. RESULTS: The average annual risks of rupture associated with small unruptured aneurysms were 0.54\% overall, 0.34\% for single aneurysms, and 0.95\% for multiple aneurysms. Patient {$<$}50 years of age (P=0.046; hazard ratio, 5.23; 95\% CI, 1.03 to 26.52), aneurysm diameter of {$>$}or=4.0 mm (P=0.023; hazard ratio, 5.86; 95\% CI, 1.27 to 26.95), hypertension (P=0.023; hazard ratio, 7.93; 95\% CI, 1.33 to 47.42), and aneurysm multiplicity (P=0.0048; hazard ratio, 4.87; 95\% CI, 1.62 to 14.65) were found to be significant predictive factors for rupture of small aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS: The annual rupture rate associated with small unruptured aneurysms is quite low. Careful attention should be paid to the treatment indications for single-type unruptured aneurysms {$<$}5 mm. If the patient is {$<$}50 years of age, has hypertension, and multiple aneurysms with diameters of {$>$}or=4 mm, treatment should be considered to prevent future aneurysmal rupture.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to review clinical outcomes following resection of giant spinal schwannomas. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective review of a case series of patients with giant spinal schwannomas at a tertiary cancer hospital. RESULTS Thirty-two patients with giant spinal schwannomas underwent surgery between September 1998 and May 2013. Tumor size ranged from 2.5 cm to 14.6 cm with a median size of 5.8 cm. There were 9 females (28.1\%) and 23 males (71.9\%), and the median age was 47 years (range 23-83 years). The median follow-up duration was 36.0 months (range 12.2-132.4 months). Three patients (9.4\%) experienced recurrence and required further treatment. All recurrences developed following subtotal resection (STR) of cellular or melanotic schwannoma. There were 3 melanotic (9.4\%) and 6 cellular (18.8\%) schwannomas included in this study. Among these histological variants, a 33.3\% recurrence rate was noted. In 1 case of melanotic schwannoma, malignant transformation occurred. No recurrence occurred following gross-total resection (GTR) or when a fibrous capsule remained due to its adherence to functional nerve roots. CONCLUSIONS Resection is the treatment of choice for symptomatic or growing giant schwannomas, frequently requiring anterior or combined approaches, with the goals of symptom relief and prevention of recurrence. In this series, tumors that underwent GTR, or where only capsule remained, did not recur. Only melanotic and cellular schwannomas that underwent STR recurred.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The options available for treatment of irreducible atlantoaxial dislocation (IAAD) with basilar invagination are odontoidectomy, posterior decompression, and posterior atlantoaxial joint distraction. In 2006, Wang et~al. described that most IAAD can be reduced following anterior release of contracted soft tissues. Anterior release may be done by transoral (TO) or retropharyngeal (RP) approach. Posterior instrumented fusion provides stability and helps in achieving further reduction. PURPOSE: This study aimed to study the neurologic and radiological outcome following treatment of basilar invagination associated with IAAD by anterior release and posterior instrumented fusion. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case series was carried out. PATIENT SAMPLE: The patient sample comprised 19 patients with IAAD. OUTCOME MEASURE: Patients were assessed for neurologic recovery by Benzel modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score and radiologically by assessing reduction on lateral radiographs and comparing clivus-canal angle (CCA) on preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scan. METHODS: Nineteen consecutive patients with IAAD were surgically treated. Anterior release was done via TO approach in 12 patients and RP approach in 7. Following anterior release, all patients underwent posterior instrumented fusion. RESULTS: This study included 15 men and 4 women with mean follow-up of 18 months. Pathology included occipitalization of atlas in 16 patients, os odontoideum in 2, and missing posterior elements of axis in 1. All patients had cervical myelopathy. Occipitocervical fixation was done in 18 patients and C1-C2 transarticular screw fixation in 1. Fifteen patients had anatomical reduction whereas four had partial reduction. The CCA improved from a mean preoperative angle of 111.47\textdegree{} to mean postoperative angle of 142.84\textdegree. The mJOA improved from preoperative mean mJOA of 12.89 to a postoperative mean mJOA of 16.84. Fusion was achieved in all patients. Maceration of posterior wound which healed by daily cleaning and dressing was noted in three patients. Implant breakage on one side was noted in 1 patient at 3 months post operation; however, the patient remained asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: This series reinforces the safety and efficacy of both TO and RP anterior release for reduction of IAAD. Posterior fixation helps in achieving further reduction and provides stability. Anterior release followed by instrumented posterior fusion is a safe and effective modality of treatment for IAAD associated with basilar invagination.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Tethered cord syndrome (TCS) is a neurosurgical disorder with varied clinical manifestations believed to result from vascular compromise due to stretch forces on the spinal cord. Conventional supine MRI findings may include a low-lying conus medullaris, thickened or fat-infiltrated filum terminale, or lipoma; however, imaging sensitivity and specificity for tethered cord can be low. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of prone MRI in the diagnosis of tethered and retethered spinal cord. METHODS Medical records were reviewed in 41 patients who underwent surgical release of tethered cord and in whom preoperative prone MRI sequences were available. Patients were divided into Group 1 (new TCS diagnosis) and Group 2 (recurrent TCS after previous untethering). Absolute conus ventral motion and motion as a percentage of canal width between supine and prone positions was measured in these 2 groups via sagittal T2-weighted sequences; these groups were compared with 30 consecutive patients (Group 3) who were classified as the normal control group. RESULTS The mean ventral motion was as follows: Group 1 (absolute: 0.5 {$\pm$} 0.5 mm [range 0-2.4 mm]; canal percentage: 3.7\% {$\pm$} 3.9\% [range 0\%-16.3\%]); Group 2 (absolute: 0.4 {$\pm$} 0.7 mm [range 0-2.6 mm]; canal percentage: 2.2\% {$\pm$} 3.7\% [range 0\%-14.0\%]); and Group 3 (absolute: 3.4 {$\pm$} 1.3 mm [range 1.4-5.6 mm]; canal percentage: 22.0\% {$\pm$} 7.2\% [range 10.5\%-36.1\%]). Whereas 38/41 surgically treated patients with TCS had diminished ({$<$} 10\% canal width) ventral motion on preoperative MRI, 30/30 controls had {$>$} 10\% canal width motion. Sensitivity and specificity were thereby calculated as 92.7\% and 100\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS In the present series, prone imaging is found to be a sensitive and specific tool, and the authors believe it may have a role as supportive evidence in the diagnosis of tethered and retethered spinal cord.},

Spine surgeons are often involved in the care of these patients only after nonoperative management has failed. Because surgery has been viewed as no better than radiotherapy in the treatment of metastasis of the spine, it has only been used as a salvage approach. These views are based on a body of literature in which laminectomy combined with radiotherapy was compared with radiotherapy alone. Anterior approaches to the spine are now popular and familiar to most surgeons. These approaches allow direct access to the metastatic lesion, reconstruction of the anterior vertebral column, and the placement of anterior instrumentation. Outcomes are frequently much better when this combined treatment is used instead of radiotherapy alone. In selected patients, surgery may be desired as first-line therapy before radio- or chemotherapy has been initiated. The controversy surrounding surgery for metastatic spinal disease is reviewed. Treatment strategies, both operative and nonoperative, are presented. Indications and strategies for surgery are also presented, and the supporting literature is reviewed.},

Several theories exist as to its embryological evolution and recently new theories are emerging as to its treatment and possible prevention. A thorough understanding of the embryology, anatomy, symptomatology, and surgical treatment is necessary to care optimally for children with myelomeningocele and prevent significant morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A review of the literature was used to summarize the clinically pertinent features of the CM II, with particular attention to pitfalls in diagnosis and surgical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Any child with CM II can present as a neurosurgical emergency. Expeditious and knowledgeable evaluation and prompt surgical decompression of the hindbrain can prevent serious morbidity and mortality in the patient with myelomeningocele, especially those younger than 2 years old. Symptomatic CM II in the older child often presents with more subtle findings but rarely in acute crisis. Understanding of CM II continues to change as innovative techniques are applied to this challenging patient population.},

The contents of the pseudocapsule tissue surrounding a schwannoma are not well described, and the consequences of resecting or leaving pseudocapsules are unknown. METHODS: An institutional database was searched for any pathology reports that contained both of the words "schwannoma" and "capsule." Charts and histopathologic specimens were reviewed to determine the contents of various tissue layers and determine if there was any correlation between pseudocapsular contents and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A pseudocapsule was separately sent for pathology in 36 patients during schwannoma resection. Ten pseudocapsule specimens contained microscopic foci of tumor. In a separate 6 patients, there was evidence of nerve fascicles. There were no correlations between the tumor or nerve in the pseudocapsule and postoperative neurologic deficits. After an average follow-up time of 3.1 years, no patients developed a recurrence either clinically or on follow-up imaging (imaging available in 52.7\%). Histopathologically, the pseudocapsule was made of dense hypocellular collagen and occasionally contained arteries, veins, and nerve fascicles. CONCLUSIONS: The pseudocapsule surrounding a schwannoma occasionally contained nerve tissue and blood vessels. While a microscopic focus of tumor was often found in this tissue layer, recurrence is exceedingly rare and did not occur in this case series. The risk of undue pseudocapsule dissection likely outweighs any negligible benefit from microscopic cytoreduction.},

The authors' hypothesis is that an arterial pulsation\textendash driven perivascular flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is responsible for syrinx formation and enlargement. They investigated normal CSF flow patterns in 20 rats and five sheep by using the tracer horseradish peroxidase; the effect of reducing arterial pulse pressure was examined in four sheep by partially ligating the brachiocephalic trunk; CSF flow was examined in 78 rats with the intraparenchymal kaolin model of noncommunicating syringomyelia; and extracanalicular cysts were examined using the excitotoxic model in 38 rats. In the normal animals there was a rapid flow of CSF from the spinal subarachnoid space into the spinal cord perivascular spaces and then into the central canal. This flow ceased when arterial pulsations were diminished. In animals with noncommunicating syringomyelia, there was rapid CSF flow into isolated and enlarged segments of central canal, even when these cysts were causing pressure damage to the surrounding spinal cord. Exitotoxic injury of the spinal cord caused the formation of extracanalicular cysts, and larger cysts were produced when this injury was combined with arachnoiditis, which impaired subarachnoid CSF flow. The results of these experiments support the hypothesis that arterial pulsation\textendash driven perivascular fluid flow is responsible for syrinx formation and enlargement.},

The technique was used to study the canal in the conus medullaris and filum terminale of 1 sheep and 4 human spinal cords. A variety of morphological features were demonstrated including canal duplication, a terminal ventricle and openings from the canal lumen into the subarachnoid space.

  abstract = {Obstruction of the intracranial dural venous sinuses would result in an increase in intracranial dural venous pressure. This intracranial hypertension is not only the result of poor cerebral venous drainage but also life threatening. The aim of this study was to identify the structures, which may show signs of potential venographic filling defect qualities, including trabeculae/septa (also described as "fibrous bands") and arachnoid granulations, which ultimately can lead to increased intracranial dural sinus venous pressure. A total of 102 cadavers and living patients were used for the study. Fifty-three percent of the subjects presented with structures in their transverse sinuses that could be potential venous filling defects. Thirty percent of the subjects presented with arachnoid granulations in the right transverse sinus, which were found to be significantly dominant (Chi-square; p {$<$} 0.05). The study also revealed the presence of 1 to 5 septa in 29.4\% of the subjects. The septa were found to be more dominant in the central (30\%) and lateral (22\%) thirds of the right transverse sinuses, while the central third of the left transverse sinus proved to be the least dominant occurring site (8\%). In general, the right transverse sinus is highly more significantly dominant in septal occurrence (Chi-square; p {$<$} 0.01) than the left transverse sinus. We conclude from the statistical evidence that the right transverse sinus demonstrates significantly more potential venographic filling defects than the left sinus and submit that this information may assist in management options for patients diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension as well as direct future research.},

METHODS: Two types of reduction tool have been designed: T-type and L-type. A T-shaped levering tool was used when a pedicle or pars screw was used for C-2, and an L-shaped tool was used when a laminar screw was used for C-2. Twenty-two patients who underwent atlantoaxial segmental screw fixation and fusion for the treatment of anteroposterior instability or subluxation, using either of these new types of reduction tool, were enrolled. Demographic, clinical, and surgical data, which had been prospectively collected in a database, were analyzed. The atlantodens interval was measured on lateral radiographs, and the space available for the spinal cord was measured on CT scans. RESULTS: The authors could attain reduction of the atlantoaxial subluxation without difficulty using either type of tool. The preoperative atlantodens interval ranged from -16.9 to 10.9 mm in a neutral position, and the postoperative interval ranged from -2.8 to 3.0 mm, with negative values due to extension-type or mixed-type instability. The mean space available for the spinal cord significantly increased, from 9.5 mm preoperatively to 15.4 mm postoperatively (p {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This technique allowed for controlled manipulation and reduction of the atlantoaxial subluxation without difficulty.},

DESIGN: Short-term longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: A rehabilitation facility. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen patients (10 men, 6 women) with chronic LBD. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were evaluated pre- and posttreatment for outcomes of functional status and muscle fatigue. Treatment consisted of patients participating in supervised spinal stabilization exercises 3 times a week over a 4-week period. Main outcome measures Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire and muscle fatigue based on electromyographically based median frequency assessed during the first 4 seconds and the last 4 seconds of a modified 1-minute Sorenson test. RESULTS: Oswestry scores improved significantly from pre- to posttreatment (22.9 vs 18.3, P{$<$}.027). A significant treatment by gender interaction (P{$<$}.031) indicated significant pre- to posttreatment loss of endurance for men (149.3 vs 143.2, P{$<$}.045) and a slight, but not statistically significant increase in endurance for women (110.7 vs. 115.5, P{$<$}.20). CONCLUSIONS: A 4-week spinal stabilization exercise program significantly improved functional status in patients presenting with LBD. However, a significant pre- to posttreatment increase in multifidi muscle fatigue for men (P{$<$}.045) coupled with a nonsignificant improvement in multifidi muscle endurance for women (P{$<$}.20) was unexpected; this may reflect an insufficiency of a 4-week program to effect muscle fatigue or a lack of sensitivity of electromyographically based median frequency as the method for assessing muscle endurance. Additional randomized controlled trials to more fully investigate treatment effects and factors that may mediate these effects are needed.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of total sagittal spinal alignment in lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LCS) patients with and without intermittent claudication. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate total sagittal spinal alignment in LCS. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The sagittal spinal alignment is an important factor in the management of lumbar degenerative diseases and lower back pain. Patients with LCS accompanied by intermittent claudication adopt a forward-bending posture during walking. However, few studies have quantitatively assessed the abnormal posture in LCS in relation to clinical symptoms. METHODS: This study analyzed 93 patients with LCS. They were divided into two groups according to the presence of neurogenic intermittent claudication; patients of the Claudicant group had intermittent claudication of the cauda equina (n = 53; mean age, 66.7) and those of the Nerve root group had no claudication (n = 40; mean age, 67.0). The following parameters were measured on the lateral whole-spine standing radiographs: the distance between the C7 plumb line and the posterior superior corner on the superior margin of S1 (sagittal vertical axis), the angle between the superior margin of the first lumbar vertebra and the first sacral vertebra (L1S1), lumbar lordotic angle, pelvic tilting angle (PA), and pelvic morphologic angle (PRS1). RESULTS: The sagittal vertical axis of the Claudicant group (57.6 +/- 37.5 mm) was significantly larger than that of the Nerve root group (40.3 +/- 42.3 mm) and was larger in both groups compared with the standard values. Lumbar lordotic angle was smaller (18.8 degrees +/- 13.2 degrees ) and pelvic tilting angle was larger (27.2 degrees +/- 8.3 degrees ) in patients with the Claudicant group than those with the Nerve root group (22.4 degrees +/- 14.0 degrees and 22.7 degrees +/- 7.2 degrees , respectively). CONCLUSION: Patients of the Claudicant group exhibited forward bending of the trunk and pelvis backtilt, compared with those of the Nerve root group.},

Image reconstruction and grid generation tools were then used to develop a three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction model of the CSF flow inside the CNS. The CSF spaces were discretized using the finite-element method and the constitutive equations for fluid and solid motion solved in ADINA-FSI 8.6. Model predictions of CSF velocity magnitude and stroke volume were found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data. CSF pressure gradients and amplitudes were computed in all regions of the CNS. The computed pressure gradients and amplitudes closely match values obtained clinically. The highest pressure amplitude of 77~Pa was predicted to occur in the lateral ventricles. The pressure gradient between the lateral ventricles and the lumbar region of the spinal canal did not exceed 132~Pa (\textasciitilde 1~mmHg) at any time during the cardiac cycle. The pressure wave speed in the spinal canal was predicted and found to agree closely with values previously reported in the literature. Finally, the forward and backward motion of the CSF in the ventricles was visualized, revealing the complex mixing patterns in the CSF spaces. The mathematical model presented in this article is a prerequisite for developing a mechanistic understanding of the relationships among vasculature pulsations, CSF flow, and CSF pressure waves in the CNS.},

We investigated the hypothesis that the integrity of the posterior complex (spinous process-interspinous ligament-spinous process) plays an important role on the postoperative spinal stability in decompressive surgery. METHODS: Eight porcine lumbar spine specimens were studied. Each specimen was tested intact and after two decompression procedures. All posterior components were preserved in Group A (Intact). In Group B (Bilateral laminotomy), the inferior margin of L4 lamina and superior margin of L5 lamina were removed, but the L4-L5 supraspinous ligament was preserved. Fenestrations were made on both sides. In Group C (Laminectomy) the lamina and spinous processes of lower L4 and upper L5 were removed. Ligamentum flavum and supraspinous ligament of L4-L5 were removed. A hydraulic testing machine was used to generate an increasing moment up to 8400 N-mm in flexion and extension. Intervertebral displacement at decompressive level L4-L5 was measured by extensometer RESULTS: The results indicated that, under extension motion, intervertebral displacement between the specimen in intact form and at two different decompression levels did not significantly differ (P {$>$} 0.05). However, under flexion motion, intervertebral displacement of the laminectomy specimens at decompression level L4-L5 was statistically greater than in intact or bilateral laminotomy specimens (P = 0.0000963 and P = 0.000418, respectively). No difference was found between intact and bilateral laminotomy groups. (P {$>$} 0.05). CONCLUSION: We concluded that a lumbar spine with posterior complex integrity is less likely to develop segment instability than a lumbar spine with a destroyed anchoring point for supraspinous ligament.},

OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to assess the relationship between epidural pressure and lumbar posture in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. METHODS: The study was performed on 10 patients who had cauda equina symptoms at the L4-L5 level. The catheter transducer was inserted into the epidural space through L5-S1 interlaminar space and placed at the L4-L5 disc level. This transducer was connected with an amplifier and a recorder. Epidural pressure was continuously measured in various postures. RESULTS: Local epidural pressure at the stenotic level was low in lying and sitting postures, and high in standing postures. Pressure was increased with extension, but decreased with flexion. The highest pressure was 116.7 +/- 38.4 mm Hg in standing with extension. CONCLUSION: Epidural pressure was significantly related to posture. These pressure changes correlated with the development of cauda equina symptoms. The increase of epidural pressure by posture may induce compression of the cauda equina. These pressure changes may explain the postural dependency in eliciting symptoms.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis and treatment of intracranial hypotension associated with a spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, especially in comatose patients, have yet to be established. METHODS: Clinical manifestations, neuroimaging findings, and treatment outcomes in 11 patients (Glasgow Coma Scale score 10 {$\pm$} 4) were described and compared with 36 patients with normal consciousness. RESULTS: Patients with disturbed consciousness were diagnosed at a significantly older age (55 {$\pm$} 11 years; P {$<$} 0.001) than those without (42 {$\pm$} 8.8 years). Neuroimaging findings in patients with disturbed consciousness were characterized by a smaller midbrain-pons angle (7.8 {$\pm$} 10\textdegree; P {$<$} 0.001), brainstem swelling (122\%; P~= 0.002), and thicker subdural hematomas (16 {$\pm$} 7.0 mm\textdegree; P {$<$} 0.001). Epidural blood patch (EBP) alone did not achieve sustained improvements in patients with disturbed consciousness but did in most patients without (94\%; P~= 0.001). Over the treatment course, 5 patients progressed to coma, which correlated with a high signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in the brainstem. Hematoma drainage before EBP caused neurologic deterioration in 2 patients. Simultaneous EBP after hematoma drainage achieved sustained improvements in 5 of 6 patients. Simultaneous microsurgical dural repair after hematoma drainage achieved more rapid improvements in 3 of 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with intracranial hypotension caused by a spinal CSF leak, disturbed consciousness may occur in elderly patients because of severe diencephalic-mesencephalic deformities. Simultaneous EBP after safe hematoma drainage is indicated for these patients. Alternatively, dural repair is indicated for patients for whom the spinal level of dural disease has been identified. Hematoma drainage before EBP is not recommended because it caused deterioration.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spinal meningioma with ventral attachment is a challenging pathology. Several technical modifications have been proposed to secure safe and precise resection of these tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study focused on the precise and safe surgery of spinal meningiomas with strictly ventral attachment of cervical or thoracic spine. The surgical technique included a lateral oblique position for the patient, laminectomy with unilateral medial facetectomy on the tumor side, and spinal cord rotation with the dentate ligament. The neurological status of patients was assessed using the modified McCormick functional schema (mMFS) and sensory pain scale (SPS) before and at least 3 months after surgery. Patients were followed-up for a mean of 23.7 months. Tumor removal was graded using the Simpson grade for removal of meningiomas, and the extent of excision was confirmed using early postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Simpson grade 1 or 2 resections were achieved in all cases. No major surgery-related complications were encountered, postoperatively. The mean mMFS score before surgery was 3.1, improving significantly to 1.7 after surgery (P {$<$} 0.05). The mean SPS score before surgery was 2.4, improving significantly to 1.6 after surgery (P {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This surgical technique offers a posterolateral surgical corridor to the ventral canal of both cervical and thoracic spine. The present preliminary analysis suggests that functional outcomes were satisfactory with minimal surgery-related complications, although considerable surgical experience is needed to achieve a high level of surgical confidence.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this study, and written informed consent was obtained from all 35 patients. We optimized continuous 2.5-mm thick lumbar coronal images with 3D FS-nSSFP and 3D T1-GRE. We calculated the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for nerve roots and other structures on images with the two sequences. With knowledge of the final diagnosis, we assessed the visibility of nerve root compression on these images. RESULTS: The CNR values of nerve roots were significantly higher on images with 3D FS-nSSFP than on those with 3D T1-GRE. These continuous thin-slice coronal images facilitated visualization of nerve root compression in {$>$}91\% of patients. There was no statistically significant difference between the two sequences in the detection of nerve root compression. CONCLUSION: Continuous thin-slice coronal MR images using 3D FS-nSSFP and 3D T1-GRE sequences are sufficient to evaluate lumbar nerve root compression, and 3D FS-nSSFP is superior to 3D T1-GRE for depiction of lumbar nerve roots.},

Objective.~         To clarify preoperative factors predicting unsatisfactory indirect decompression after laminoplasty in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy.         Summary of Background Data.~         Many authors have shown that inadequate indirect decompression after laminoplasty can inhibit neural recovery and should be considered a complication. We previously demonstrated that residual anterior compression of the spinal cord (ACS) impaired recovery of upper extremity motor function. Although the K-line has been established as a predictive index indicating that laminoplasty is required in patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, it remains unclear what preoperative factors can predict insufficient posterior cord decompression in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy.         Methods.~         Forty-six consecutive patients who underwent laminoplasty for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy at our hospital were reviewed. A modified K-line was defined as the line connecting the midpoints of the spinal cord at C2 and C7 on a T1-weighted sagittal magnetic resonance image. We also determined the minimum interval between the tip of local kyphosis and a line connecting the midpoint of the cord at the level of the inferior endplates of C2 and C7 (INTmin) on the midsagittal image. Data analysis involved logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to select the most valuable index for predicting postoperative ACS.         Results.~         Ten patients had ACS immediately after laminoplasty. Logistic regression analysis showed that INTmin was a significant predictive factor for the occurrence of postoperative ACS (odds ratio = 0.485; 95\% confidence interval = 0.29\textendash 0.81; P = 0.02). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.871. A cutoff of 4.0 mm had a sensitivity of 80\% and a specificity of 80.6\% for prediction of postoperative ACS.         Conclusion.~         The parameter INTmin correlated with the occurrence of postoperative ACS. A cutoff point of 4.0 mm is most appropriate for alerting spine surgeons to a high likelihood of postoperative ACS.},

Nine patients had 13 examinations, 6 preoperative, 3 after syringosubarachnoid shunting and 4 after posterior fossa decompression. Five controls were also examined. Dynamic display of the acquired images demonstrated downward displacement of the presaturation bolus on the cerebellar tonsils and medulla oblongata (or upper cervical cord) at the C1 level in all preoperative examinations and in two patients after syringosubarachnoid shunting but with residual foramen magnum obstruction. Downward displacement of the bolus on the cervical spinal cord was also demonstrated in 7 examinations, but not observed in the controls. Thus, the hind-brain-spinal cord axis showed larger pulsatile movements in patients with foramen magnum obstruction. Based on these observations and a review of the literature, a new theory on the mode of extension of syringomyelia, emphasising the role of increased pulsatile movement of the hind-brain-spinal cord axis is proposed: that the pulsatile movements, together with a one-way valve mechanism in the syrinx cavity act as a "vacuum-pump" to enlarge the syrinx.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Recently, limited decompression procedures have been proposed in the treatment of lumbar stenosis. The authors undertook a prospective study to compare the safety and outcome of unilateral and bilateral laminotomy with laminectomy. METHODS: One hundred twenty consecutive patients with 207 levels of lumbar stenosis without herniated discs or instability were randomized to three treatment groups (bilateral laminotomy [Group 1], unilateral laminotomy [Group 2], and laminectomy [Group 3]). Perioperative parameters and complications were documented. Symptoms and scores, such as visual analog scale (VAS), Roland-Morris Scale, Short Form-36 (SF-36), and patient satisfaction were assessed preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Adequate decompression was achieved in all patients. The overall complication rate was lowest in patients who had undergone bilateral laminotomy (Group 1). The minimum follow up of 12 months was obtained in 94\% of patients. Residual pain was lowest in Group 1 (VAS score 2.3 +/- 2.4 and 4 +/- 1 in Group 3; p {$<$} 0.05 and 3.6 +/- 2.7 in Group 2; p {$<$} 0.05). The Roland-Morris Scale score improved from 17 +/- 4.3 before surgery to 8.1 +/- 7, 8.5 +/- 7.3, and 10.9 +/- 7.5 (Groups 1-3, respectively; p {$<$} 0.001 compared with preoperative) corresponding to a dramatic increase in walking distance. Examination of SF-36 scores demonstrated marked improvement, most pronounced in Group 1. The number of repeated operations did not differ among groups. Patient satisfaction was significantly superior in Group 1, with 3, 27, and 26\% of patients unsatisfied (in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively; p {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral and unilateral laminotomy allowed adequate and safe decompression of lumbar stenosis, resulted in a highly significant reduction of symptoms and disability, and improved health-related quality of life. Outcome after unilateral laminotomy was comparable with that after laminectomy. In most outcome parameters, bilateral laminotomy was associated with a significant benefit and thus constitutes a promising treatment alternative.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized clinical study. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate supplementary pedicle screw fixation (Cotrel-Dubousset) in posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The rationale behind lumbar fusion is to eliminate pathologic motion to relieve pain. To improve fusion rates and to allow reduction, a rigid transpedicular screw fixation may be beneficial, but the positive effect of this may be counter-balanced by an increase in complications. METHODS: The inclusion criteria were severe, chronic low back pain from spondylolisthesis Grades 1 and 2 or from primary or secondary degenerative segmental instability. One hundred thirty patients were randomly allocated to receive no instrumentation (n = 66) or Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation (n = 64) in posterolateral lumbar fusion. Variables were registered at the time of surgery and at 1 and 2 years after surgery. RESULTS: Follow-up was achieved in 97.7\% of the patients. Fusion rates deduced from plain radiographs were not significantly different between instrumented and noninstrumented groups. The functional outcome assessed by the Dallas Pain Questionnaire improved significantly in both groups, and there were no significant differences in results between the two groups, except for significantly better (P {$<$} 0.06) functional outcome in relation to daily activities in the instrumented group when neural decompression had been performed. The global patients' satisfaction was 82\% in the instrumented group versus 74\% in the noninstrumented group (not significant). Fixation of instrumentation increased operation time, blood loss, and early reoperation rate significantly. Patients experienced only a few minor postoperative complications; none were major. Two infections appeared in the Cotrel-Dubousset group. Significant symptoms from misplacement of pedicle screws were seen in 4.8\% of the instrumented patients. CONCLUSIONS: Lumbar posterolateral fusion with pedicle screw fixation increases the operation time, blood loss, and reoperation rate, and leads to a significant risk of nerve injury. The functional outcome improves significantly with high patient satisfaction, with or without instrumentation. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in functional outcome and fusion rate. The only gain in functional outcome from instrumentation was found in the daily activity category in patients with supplementary neural decompression. The results of this study do not justify the general use of pedicle screw fixation alone as an adjunct to posterolateral lumbar fusion.},

We describe five cases of large ectatic vertebral artery causing compression and distortion of the medulla oblongata with pyramidal tract signs and low cranial nerve dysfunction. Microvascular decompression by retracting the vertebral artery and anchoring it to the dura has been the treatment of choice. METHODS: Five patients, four male and one female, presented with progressive myelopathic features and lower cranial nerve dysfunction, especially dysphonia and dysphagia. Four patients were affected by systemic arterial hypertension. Magnetic resonance imaging showed impingement of the right vertebral artery in three patients and the left vertebral artery in two patients, on the right and left lateral medulla, respectively. In two patients, hypoplasia of the contralateral vertebral artery was documented. RESULTS: All patients underwent neurovascular decompression of the medulla oblongata. The ectatic and tortuous vertebral artery was detached from the medulla, shifted away, and repositioned by anchoring to the nearby dura mater using a Gore-Tex vascular slip. Postoperatively, all patients but one had improvement of their previous neurological symptoms. CONCLUSION: Brainstem dysfunction caused by a tortuous ectatic vertebral artery might be less uncommon than expected. It should be considered a new distinct clinical entity, the real incidence of which needs to be carefully evaluated by an appropriate diagnostic protocol, which includes primarily magnetic resonance imaging with specific three-dimensional sequences. Awareness of this condition is necessary to ensure the appropriate treatment. Surgical microvascular decompression seems very effective.},

Herein, we report intraoperative and microscopic findings relating to an outermost dura-like membrane in cases of vestibular schwannoma and the importance of these findings. METHODS: Intraoperative findings of 16 cases of vestibular schwannoma treated with an initial surgery were studied with an aim to determine if the cases had a dura-like membrane. Then we studied microscopic findings of the dura-like membrane using hematoxylin and eosin, Masson trichrome, and immunohistochemical staining in 2 cases. RESULTS: The dura-like membrane was observed in 8 out of 16 cases. The average tumor size of the cases that had a dura-like membrane was 30 {$\pm$} 8.1 mm, and Koos grading 4 was in 7 out of 8 cases, and one was grade 3. In cases without a dura-like membrane, these values were significantly smaller, with an average tumor size of 12.8 {$\pm$} 5.2 mm, and Koos grading 4 was only in 1 of 8 cases, grade 3 was in 2 cases, and other 5 cases were grade 2. The outermost dura-like membrane enveloped the vestibular schwannoma around the internal acoustic meatus and was continuous with the dura mater. Reactive angiogenesis was observed in the dura mater. Microscopic findings proved its continuity with the dura mater. In one case, the facial nerve was damaged before it was identified during subcapsular dissection. In that case, the dura-like membrane negatively affected our ability to identify the facial nerve. CONCLUSIONS: A dura-like membrane sometimes envelops vestibular schwannoma around the internal acoustic meatus. Recognition of this membranous structure is important for the surgical preservation of facial and acoustic nerves.},

  abstract = {A 16 year old girl did a handstand for fun, returned to her feet, experienced a sudden pain in her back, and became progressively paraplegic within 30 hours. MRI showed lumbar cord swelling, multiple Schmorl's nodes, a collapsed T11-T12 disc space, and intraspongious disc prolapse into the T12 vertebral body. These findings, related to the initial manoeuvre, suggested that an acute vertical disc herniation could have occurred as the first step in a process leading to spinal cord infarction due to fibrocartilaginous emboli from the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc. The medical literature so far reports 32 cases of fibrocartilaginous embolism (FCE) of the spinal cord, all at necropsy, with the exception of one histologically demonstrated in a living patient. A clinical diagnosis of FCE would be desirable for many important reasons, but was never made. This causes severe limitations in the knowledge of the disease and precludes any therapeutic possibility. On the basis of the clinical features and findings in the present case, compared with data from the reported cases, a first attempt is made to identify the clinical context within which new information obtainable through MRI examination can lead to a reliable clinical diagnosis of FCE. The vexed question of the pathogenesis has been reviewed. An increased intraosseous pressure within the vertebral body, due to acute vertical disc herniation, seems to offer a consistent pathogenetic explanation and some therapeutic prospects.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective clinical cohort study at a single spine center of patients with degenerative scoliosis and radiculopathy severe enough to require surgery. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the functional outcomes of 3 surgeries for degenerative scoliosis with radiculopathy; decompression alone, decompression and limited fusion, and decompression and full curve fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although these 3 surgical treatments have all been described for this problem, there exists little information as to what outcomes to expect. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 85 patients who met the inclusion criteria of degenerative scoliosis and radiculopathy, who had undergone 1 of the above 3 surgeries, who had not had any previous lumbar spine surgery, who had a minimum follow-up of at least 2 years, and who had filled out preoperative and postoperative functional evaluation forms including SF-36, Oswestry Disability Index, Roland Morris Scores, and a satisfaction questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to predict the likelihood of success as related to decompression alone of rotatory olisthetic segments, extent of fusion, and postoperative sagittal balance. Patient demographics including curve magnitude, operative blood loss, length of hospital stay, complications, and need for revision surgeries were analyzed. The patients having decompression alone had the highest mean age (76.4 years) compared to decompression and limited fusion (70.4), and decompression and full curve fusion (62.5). RESULTS: Cobb scoliosis angles remained unchanged in the 2 groups not having full curve fusion, while the full curve fusion group changed from a mean 39\textdegree{} before surgery to 19\textdegree{} at follow-up. The complication rate was highest (56\%) in the full fusion group, was 40\% in the limited fusion group, and 10\% in the decompression alone group. The overall SF-36 analysis showed significant improvement in bodily pain, social function, role emotional, mental health, and mental composite domains. Oswestry Disability Indexes improved significantly in the decompression alone and limited fusion groups, but not in the full fusion group. In contrast, the satisfaction questionnaire showed the highest success to be in the full-curve fusion group and the lowest in the decompression-only group.Regression analysis revealed that sacrum to curve apex fusions and positive postoperative sagittal imbalance were associated with poor outcomes. CONCLUSION: Both good and poor results were seen with each of the 3 procedures.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The diagnosis and treatment of Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) has evolved over the last few decades. The authors present their surgical experience of over 2 decades of treating children with this form of hindbrain herniation. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of their institutional experience with the surgical treatment of the pediatric CM-I from 1989 to 2010. RESULTS: The 2 most common presentations were headache/neck pain (40\%) and scoliosis (18\%). Common associated diagnoses included neurofibromatosis Type 1 (5\%) and idiopathic growth hormone deficiency (4.2\%). Spine anomalies included scoliosis (18\%), retroversion of the odontoid process (24\%), Klippel-Feil anomaly (3\%), and atlantooccipital fusion (8\%). Approximately 3\% of patients had a known family member with CM-I. Hydrocephalus was present in 48 patients (9.6\%). Syringomyelia was present in 285 patients (57\%), and at operation, 12\% of patients with syringomyelia were found to have an arachnoid veil occluding the fourth ventricular outlet. Fifteen patients (3\%) have undergone reoperation for continued symptoms or persistent large syringomyelia. The most likely symptoms and signs to resolve following surgery were Valsalva-induced headache and syringomyelia. The average hospital stay and "return to school" time were 3 and 12 days, respectively. The follow-up for this group ranged from 2 months to 15 years (mean 5 years). Complications occurred in 2.4\% of cases; there was no mortality. No patient required acute return to the operating room, and no blood transfusions were performed. CONCLUSIONS: The authors believe this to be the largest reported series of surgically treated pediatric CM-I patients and hope that their experience will be of use to others who treat this surgical entity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The natural history of unruptured cerebral aneurysms has not been clearly defined. METHODS: From January 2001 through April 2004, we enrolled patients with newly identified, unruptured cerebral aneurysms in Japan. Information on the rupture of aneurysms, deaths, and the results of periodic follow-up examinations were recorded. We included 5720 patients 20 years of age or older (mean age, 62.5 years; 68\% women) who had saccular aneurysms that were 3 mm or more in the largest dimension and who initially presented with no more than a slight disability. RESULTS: Of the 6697 aneurysms studied, 91\% were discovered incidentally. Most aneurysms were in the middle cerebral arteries (36\%) and the internal carotid arteries (34\%). The mean ({$\pm$}SD) size of the aneurysms was 5.7{$\pm$}3.6 mm. During a follow-up period that included 11,660 aneurysm-years, ruptures were documented in 111 patients, with an annual rate of rupture of 0.95\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 1.15). The risk of rupture increased with increasing size of the aneurysm. With aneurysms that were 3 to 4 mm in size as the reference, the hazard ratios for size categories were as follows: 5 to 6 mm, 1.13 (95\% CI, 0.58 to 2.22); 7 to 9 mm, 3.35 (95\% CI, 1.87 to 6.00); 10 to 24 mm, 9.09 (95\% CI, 5.25 to 15.74); and 25 mm or larger, 76.26 (95\% CI, 32.76 to 177.54). As compared with aneurysms in the middle cerebral arteries, those in the posterior and anterior communicating arteries were more likely to rupture (hazard ratio, 1.90 [95\% CI, 1.12 to 3.21] and 2.02 [95\% CI, 1.13 to 3.58], respectively). Aneurysms with a daughter sac (an irregular protrusion of the wall of the aneurysm) were also more likely to rupture (hazard ratio, 1.63; 95\% CI, 1.08 to 2.48). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the natural course of unruptured cerebral aneurysms varies according to the size, location, and shape of the aneurysm.

OBJECTIVE: To validate our surgical technique for in situ decompression in the lateral decubitus position, comparing results with other techniques used in our institutions. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed from January 2009 to February 2016, of 188 patients with cubital tunnel syndrome 115 males, 73 females; mean age, 53.44 {$\pm$} 12.12 years standard deviation (range, 18-84 years) treated with in situ decompression in the lateral or supine positions or transposition (subcutaneous or submuscular). The lateral decubitus group received local anesthesia and the remainder received a brachial plexus block. Clinical and electrophysiologic results between these 4 groups were compared. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant demographic differences between groups. Results were better in in situ decompression groups compared with transpositions. Mean follow-up was 1511.1 {$\pm$} 770.57 days standard deviation (range, 310-4203 days). There were no recurrences or residual elbow pain/dysesthesia/anesthetic scar/hyperesthesia/neuroma in the lateral decubitus group. Complication and recurrence rates were in direct correlation to incision size. The worst results were seen in transpositions, particularly in the submuscular group. In situ decompression in the supine position had better results than transpositions but worse than those performed in lateral decubitus. Smaller surgical wound correlates with a reduction in operating time, costs, complication rates, and time out of work. CONCLUSIONS: In situ decompression is equally as effective as ulnar nerve transpositions but with fewer complications and recurrences. In the lateral decubitus position, the retroepicondylar tunnel is more accessible, allowing smaller incisions and better results.},

A variety of approaches, usually requiring large exposures, removal of facets and pars interarticularis, and spinal stabilization, have been described. The aim of this study is to describe the "dual approach," a less invasive technique for the excision of these lesions. METHODS: A large intradural and extradural schwannoma with paraspinal extension (Eden type II) was removed by a unilateral approach-midline, pars and facet sparing and no supplemental instrumentation. RESULTS: Complete excision was achieved through the described approach, with minimal removal of bone and soft tissue disruption. There were no intraoperative or perioperative complications and no evidence of residual tumor or instability/deformity. CONCLUSIONS: The dual approach is a novel and unique technique that allows complete and safe removal of large intradural and extradural dumbbell tumors through a less invasive approach and no need for instrumentation.},

This study evaluated the impact of arachnoid violation with tonsil thermocoagulation during surgical craniovertebral junction decompression. METHODS: The evaluation included aspects of the neurologic examination and parameters of cerebrospinal fluid flow on magnetic resonance imaging during preoperative and postoperative periods. All patients underwent craniovertebral junction decompression and opening of the dura mater. Patients were divided into 2 study groups. Patients in group 1 did not undergo arachnoid violation. Patients in group 2 underwent tonsil manipulation and systematic opening of the fourth ventricle outlet. RESULTS: There were 16 patients enrolled in each group (total of 32 patients). Regarding clinical improvement, there were no significant differences between groups in the postoperative period. Group 2 had more adverse events (relative risk 2.45, 95\% confidence interval 1.55-3.86). In terms of cerebrospinal fluid flow parameter analyses, patients in group 1 achieved better results (P {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For treatment of symptomatic type 1 Chiari malformation, craniovertebral junction decompression with arachnoid preservation (i.e., without tonsillar manipulation) seems more suitable than the addition of arachnoid opening and thermocoagulation of the tonsils.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) are increasingly detected and are an important health-care burden. We aimed to assess the prevalence of UIAs according to family history, comorbidity, sex, age, country, and time period. METHODS: Through searches of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science we updated our 1998 systematic review up to March, 2011. We calculated prevalences and prevalence ratios (PRs) with random-effects binomial meta-analysis. We assessed time trends with year of study as a continuous variable. FINDINGS: We included 68 studies, which reported on 83 study populations and 1450 UIAs in 94\hphantom{,}912 patients from 21 countries. The overall prevalence was estimated as 3{$\cdot$}2\% (95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}9-5{$\cdot$}2) in a population without comorbidity, with a mean age of 50 years, and consisting of 50\% men. Compared with populations without the comorbidity, PRs were 6{$\cdot$}9 (95\% CI 3{$\cdot$}5-14) for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), 3{$\cdot$}4 (1{$\cdot$}9-5{$\cdot$}9) for a positive family history of intracranial aneurysm of subarachnoid haemorrhage, 3{$\cdot$}6 (0{$\cdot$}4-30) for brain tumour, 2{$\cdot$}0 (0{$\cdot$}9-4{$\cdot$}6) for pituitary adenoma, and 1{$\cdot$}7 (0{$\cdot$}9-3{$\cdot$}0) for atherosclerosis. The PR for women compared with men was 1{$\cdot$}61 (1{$\cdot$}02-2{$\cdot$}54), with a ratio of 2{$\cdot$}2 (1{$\cdot$}3-3{$\cdot$}6) in study populations with a mean age of more than 50 years. Compared with patients older than 80 years, we found no differences by age, except for patients younger than 30 years (0{$\cdot$}01, 0{$\cdot$}00-0{$\cdot$}12). Compared with the USA, PRs were similar for other countries, including Japan (0{$\cdot$}8, 0{$\cdot$}4-1{$\cdot$}7) and Finland (1{$\cdot$}0, 0{$\cdot$}4-2{$\cdot$}4). There was no statistically significant time trend. INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of UIAs is higher in patients with ADPKD or a positive family history of intracranial aneurysm of subarachnoid haemorrhage than in people without comorbidity. In Finland and Japan, the higher incidence of subarachnoid haemorrhage is not explained by a higher prevalence of UIAs, implicating higher risks of rupture.

Posterior approach is less invasive and demanding; however, it has been associated with increased risk of spinal cord injury. We evaluated ten consecutive patients that underwent surgery for spinal meningiomas. All patients were preoperative assessed by neurological examination, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. All tumors were ventrally located and removed via a posterior approach. Transcranial motor-evoked potentials (TcMEPs), somatosensory-evoked potential (SSEP) and free running electromyography (EMG) were monitored intraoperative. Postoperative all patients had regular follow-up examinations. There were four males and six females. The mean age was 68.2 years (range 39-82 years). In nine out of ten cases, the tumor was located in the thoracic spine. A case of a lumbar meningioma was recorded. The most common presenting symptom was motor and sensory deficits and unsteady gait, whereas no patient presented with paraplegia. All meningiomas were operated using a microsurgical technique via a posterior approach. During the operation, free running EMG monitoring prompted a surgical alert in case of irritation, whereas TcMEP and SSEP amplitudes remained unchanged. Histopathology revealed the presence of typical (World Health Organisation grade I) meningiomas. The mean Ki-67/MIB-1 index was 2.75\% (range 0.5-7). None of our patients sustained a transient or permanent motor deficit. After a mean follow-up period of 26 months (range 56-16 months), no tumor recurrence and no instability were found. Posterior approach for anteriorly located meningiomas is a safe procedure with the use of intraoperative monitoring, less invasive and well-tolerated especially in older patients. Complete tumor excision can be performed with satisfactory results.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The intracranial pulse pressure is often increased when neuropathology is present, particularly in cases of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) such as occurs in hydrocephalus. This pulse pressure is assumed to originate from arterial blood pressure oscillations entering the cranium; the fact that there is a coupling between the arterial blood pressure and the ICP is undisputed. In this study, the nature of this coupling and how it changes under conditions of increased ICP are investigated. METHODS: In 12 normal dogs, intracarotid and parenchymal pulse pressure were measured and their coupling was characterized using amplitude and phase transfer function analysis. Mean intracranial ICP was manipulated via infusions of isotonic saline into the spinal subarachnoid space, and changes in transfer function were monitored. RESULTS: Under normal conditions, the ICP wave led the arterial wave, and there was a minimum in the pulse pressure amplitude near the frequency of the heart rate. Under conditions of decreased intracranial compliance, the ICP wave began to lag behind the arterial wave and increased significantly in amplitude. Most interestingly, in many animals the pulse pressure exhibited a minimum in amplitude at a mean pressure that coincided with the transition from a leading to lagging ICP wave. CONCLUSIONS: This transfer function behavior is characteristic of a resonant notch system. This may represent a component of the intracranial Windkessel mechanism, which protects the microvasculature from arterial pulsatility. The impairment of this resonant notch system may play a role in the altered pulse pressure in conditions such as hydrocephalus and traumatic brain swelling. New models of intracranial dynamics are needed for understanding the frequency-sensitive behavior elucidated in these studies and could open a path for development of new therapies that are geared toward addressing the pulsation dysfunction in pathological conditions, such as hydrocephalus and traumatic brain injury, affecting ICP and flow dynamics.},

We performed this meta-analysis aiming to compare the effects of different nutritional support modalities on clinical outcomes of TBI patients. Methods We systematically searched Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library until October, 2012. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized prospective studies (NPSs) that compared the effects of different routes, timings, or formulae of feeding on outcomes in TBI patients were selected. The primary outcomes included mortality and poor outcome. The secondary outcomes included the length of hospital stay, the length of ventilation days, and the rate of infectious or feeding-related complications. Findings 13 RCTs and 3 NPSs were included. The pooled data demonstrated that, compared with delayed feeding, early feeding was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of mortality (relative risk [RR] = 0.35; 95\% CI, 0.24\textendash 0.50), poor outcome (RR = 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.54\textendash 0.91), and infectious complications (RR = 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.59\textendash 0.99). Compared with enteral nutrition, parenteral nutrition showed a slight trend of reduction in the rate of mortality (RR = 0.61; 95\% CI, 0.34\textendash 1.09), poor outcome (RR = 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.51\textendash 1.04), and infectious complications (RR = 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.66\textendash 1.22), whereas without statistical significances. The immune-enhancing formula was associated with a significant reduction in infection rate compared with the standard formula (RR = 0.54; 95\% CI, 0.35\textendash 0.82). Small-bowel feeding was found to be with a decreasing rate of pneumonia compared with nasogastric feeding (RR = 0.41; 95\% CI, 0.22\textendash 0.76). Conclusion After TBI, early initiation of nutrition is recommended. It appears that parenteral nutrition is superior to enteral nutrition in improving outcomes. Our results lend support to the use of small-bowel feeding and immune-enhancing formulae in reducing infectious complications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To determine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics and morphology in Chiari I malformation (CMI) and assess the response to surgery of the posterior cranial fossa, we examined midsagittal imaging along with anterior cervical 2-3 (AC2-3), posterior cervical 2-3 (PC2-3), and aqueduct CSF flow hydrodynamics in axial imaging by using cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PCMR). METHOD: We examined 52 patients with CMI, both with and without syringomyelia (SM), pre-/post-surgery, and compared them to 17 healthy volunteers. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests, independent-samples t-tests, binary logistic regression, and crosstab with MedCalc software. RESULTS: Patients with CMI had significantly shorter clivus length and larger tentorial angle than the healthy controls (P\,=\,0.004, P\,=\,0.019, respectively). The AC2-3 cranial/caudal peak velocity (PV), PC2-3 cranial/caudal PV and aqueduct cranial peak PV of patients with CMI were significantly lower than healthy volunteers pre-surgery (P\,=\,0.034 AC2-3 cranial PV, P\,=\,0.000002 AC2-3 caudal PV; P\,=\,0.046 PC2-3 cranial PV, P\,=\,0.015 PC2-3 caudal PV; P\,=\,0.022 aqueduct cranial PV) and increased after surgery (P\,=\,0.024 AC2-3 cranial PV, P\,=\,0.002 AC2-3 caudal PV; P\,=\,0.001 PC2-3 cranial PV, P\,=\,0.032 PC2-3 caudal PV; P\,=\,0.003 aqueduct cranial PV). The aqueduct caudal PV of patients with CMI was higher than that of healthy controls (P\,=\,0.004) and decreased post-surgery (P\,=\,0.012). Patients with pre-surgery PC2-3 cranial PV {$>$}2.63 cm/s and aqueduct cranial PV {$>$}2.13 cm/s, respectively, experienced primary symptom improvement after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The innate bony dysontogenesis in patients with CMI contributes to tonsilar ectopia and exacerbates CSF flow obstruction. A pressure gradient that existed between SM and SAS supports the perivascular space theory that is used to explain SM formation. Our findings demonstrate that PCMR maybe a useful tool for predicting patient prognosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acquired Chiari malformations (ACM) and associated syringomyelia secondary to space-occupying lesions can cause neurologic deficits independent of or in combination with the offending mass. Although type I Chiari malformations are traditionally treated with posterior fossa decompression, optimal surgical management of ACM and associated syringomyelia remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to review the current literature surrounding the management of ACM. METHODS: A systematic review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Using the relevant keywords, articles were identified through multiple databases from inception to April 2016. Our primary outcome was postoperative resolution of tonsillar herniation, syringomyelia, and clinical symptoms and signs. RESULTS: Thirty studies (27 case reports and 3 case series), encompassing 44 patients, were included in the review. Meningiomas (36\%) and arachnoid cysts (32\%) were the lesions most commonly associated with ACM. Offending lesions were usually large (85\%) and almost all were found in the posterior fossa (89\%). Syringomyelia was present in 82\% of cases. Overall, all but 1 patient had improvement or resolution of their syringomyelia after surgery and none required a syrinx shunt. Rates of tonsillar ascent, syrinx resolution, and neurologic recovery were similar in patients who underwent lesion removal alone versus those who underwent posterior fossa decompression and lesion removal. CONCLUSIONS: Space-occupying lesions in the posterior fossa are a rare cause of ACM and syringomyelia. Surgical management of the underlying lesion improves ACM and associated syringomyelia without the need for syrinx shunting.},

Surgical ligation of CVF has been reported, but clinical outcomes are not well described. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical efficacy of surgical ligation for treatment of CVF. METHODS: Outcomes metrics were collected in this prospective, single-arm, cross-sectional investigation. Inclusion criteria were as follows: diagnosis of SIH, demonstration of CVF on myelography, and surgical treatment of CVF. Pre- and postoperative headache severity was assessed with the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), a validated headache scale ranging from 36 (asymptomatic) to 78 (most severe). Patient satisfaction with treatment was measured with Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). RESULTS: Twenty subjects were enrolled, with mean postoperative follow-up at 16.0~{$\pm~$}9.7 mo. All CVFs were located in the thoracic region (between T4 and T12). Pretreatment headache severity was high (mean HIT-6 scores 65~{$\pm~$}6). Surgical treatment resulted in marked improvement in headache severity (mean HIT-6 change of -21~{$\pm~$}-9, mean postoperative HIT-6 of 44~{$\pm~$}8). Of subjects with baseline headache scores in the most severe category, 83\% showed a major improvement in severity (transition to the lowest 2 severity categories) after surgery. All subjects (100\%) reported clinically significant levels of satisfaction with treatment (PGIC score 6 or 7); 90\% reported the highest level of satisfaction. There were no short- or long-term complications or 30-d readmissions. CONCLUSION: Surgical ligation is highly effective for the treatment of SIH due to CVF. Larger controlled trials with longer follow-up period are indicated to better assess its long-term efficacy and safety profile.},

METHODS: Sixteen patients with SFT/HPCs of the spinal cord were enrolled in this study. Data on clinical presentation, radiologic findings, histopathologic features, surgical treatment, adjuvant therapy, and prognosis were retrospectively reviewed. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to identify the prognostic factors for recurrence and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Our series included 6 men and 10 women, with a male/female ratio of 1:1.7. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed slightly hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images for all 16 patients. All tumors showed positive immunohistochemical staining for signal transducer and activator of transcription 6. Statistical analysis of clinical data showed that age, gender, tumor location, tumor size, medullary compartment location, and Ki-67 index were not associated with recurrence and OS (P {$>$} 0.05). However, World Health Organization grade III was significantly associated with recurrence (P {$<$} 0.01). Gross total resection (GTR) and postoperative radiotherapy significantly reduced recurrence (P {$<$} 0.01 and P {$<$} 0.05), but only GTR showed remarkable benefits to improve OS (P {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SFT/HPCs of spinal cord are rare neoplasms with a propensity to recur. Hyperintensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging combined with positive immunohistochemical staining for signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 are important clues for classification and differentiation of these tumors. The extent of resection, World Health Organization grade, and postoperative radiotherapy might be predictive factors for recurrence. Complete tumor resection should be sought whenever possible, and adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended after surgical resection. Moreover, regular and long-term follow-up is mandatory to monitor recurrence.},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the morphologic features of proximal vertebral fractures in adults following spinal deformity surgery using segmental pedicle screw instrumentation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Fractures above pedicle screw constructs are a clinical problem that warrants further investigation for prevention and treatment. METHODS: Ten adult patients (6 lumbar scoliosis, 4 degenerative sagittal imbalance) who underwent segmental spinal instrumented fusion were analyzed. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the features of vertebral fracture: upper instrumented vertebral collapse + adjacent vertebral subluxation (SUB group: n = 5), and adjacent vertebral fracture (Fracture group: n = 5). RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated a high frequency of osteopenia and all patients in the SUB group had comorbidities before surgery. The SUB group demonstrated a shorter interval between initial surgery and the fracture (subluxation: 3 +/- 1.9 months; fracture: 33 +/- 25.3 months, P {$<$} 0.05), and hypokyphosis (T5-T12) in the thoracic region before surgery (SUB: 13 degrees +/- 6.4 degrees; fracture: 33 degrees +/- 15.6 degrees). Both groups demonstrated severe global sagittal imbalance (SUB: 151 +/- 62.8 mm; fracture: 94 +/- 102.2 mm), and hypolordosis (T12-S1) in the lumbar spine (SUB: -19 degrees +/- 24.4 degrees ; fracture: -33 degrees +/- 22.7 degrees) before surgery. Global sagittal imbalance in the SUB group was corrected to 8 +/- 17.4 mm immediately postoperative (P {$<$} 0.05), but increased to 64 +/- 19.9 mm after the junctional fractures (P {$<$} 0.05). The SUB group demonstrated a significantly higher wedging rate (SUB: 65\% +/- 12.4\%; fracture: 36\% +/- 16.0\%, P {$<$} 0.05) and greater local kyphosis (SUB: 42 degrees +/- 11.1 degrees; fracture: 17 degrees +/- 4.1 degrees, P {$<$} 0.05) after the fracture. Two of 5 patients in the SUB group demonstrated severe neurologic deficit from E to B after the fractures by a modified Frankel classification. CONCLUSION: Old age, osteopenia, preoperative comorbidities, and severe global sagittal imbalance were found to be frequent in patients with proximal junctional fracture. In addition, marked correction of sagittal malalignment might be considered as a risk factor of upper instrumented vertebra collapse followed by adjacent vertebral subluxation, which occurred in the first 6 months after corrective surgery with the potential for causing severe neurologic deficit because of the severe local kyphotic deformity.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Randomized trial and concurrent observational cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To compare 4 year outcomes of surgery to nonoperative care for spinal stenosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Surgery for spinal stenosis has been shown to be more effective compared to nonoperative treatment over 2 years, but longer-term data have not been analyzed. METHODS: Surgical candidates from 13 centers in 11 US states with at least 12 weeks of symptoms and confirmatory imaging were enrolled in a randomized cohort (RC) or observational cohort (OC). Treatment was standard decompressive laminectomy or standard nonoperative care. Primary outcomes were SF-36 bodily pain (BP) and physical function scales and the modified Oswestry Disability index assessed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and yearly up to 4 years. RESULTS: A total of 289 patients enrolled in the RC and 365 patients enrolled in the OC. An as-treated analysis combining the RC and OC and adjusting for potential confounders found that the clinically significant advantages for surgery previously reported were maintained through 4 years, with treatment effects (defined as mean change in surgery group minus mean change in nonoperative group) for bodily pain 12.6 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 8.5-16.7); physical function 8.6 (95\% CI, 4.6-12.6); and Oswestry Disability index -9.4 (95\% CI, -12.6 to -6.2). Early advantages for surgical treatment for secondary measures such as bothersomeness, satisfaction with symptoms, and self-rated progress were also maintained. CONCLUSION: Patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis treated surgically compared to those treated nonoperatively maintain substantially greater improvement in pain and function through 4 years.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The authors explore the risk of rupture in aneurysms categorized by size. METHODS: A computerized database of 945 patients with aneurysms treated between 1967 and 1987 was retrospectively established. All available clinical and radiological studies were abstracted. Because of the recent interest in the size of intracranial aneurysms in relation to their likelihood of rupture, the database was searched with respect to this parameter. In 390 patients representing 41\% of all cases, aneurysms were measured by neuroradiologists at the time of diagnosis. In 78\% of the 945 patients there was only one aneurysm, and of the 507 aneurysms that were measured, 60\% were solitary. Of all patients, 86\% had ruptured aneurysms. The average age of all patients was 47 years, and for those with ruptured aneurysms it was 46 years. Of the ruptured aneurysms, 77\% were 10 mm or smaller, compared with 85\% of the unruptured aneurysms. It was found that 40.3\% of the ruptured aneurysms were on the anterior cerebral artery or anterior communicating artery, compared with 13\% of the unruptured aneurysms. None of the cavernous internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms were ruptured and 65\% of the ophthalmic artery (OphA) aneurysms were. Of the unruptured aneurysms, 15\% were located in the cavernous ICA or the OphA. Of the ruptured aneurysms, 29\% were on the middle cerebral artery, compared with 36\% of the unruptured aneurysms. The mean size of ruptured and unruptured aneurysms showed no statistically significant increase with patient age, although the difference in size between the ruptured and unruptured aneurysms decreased with increasing age. The mean size of all ruptured aneurysms (10.8 mm) was significantly larger than the mean size of all unruptured aneurysms (7.8 mm, p {$<$} 0.001); the median sizes were 10 mm and 5 mm, respectively. The size of ruptured aneurysms in patients who died in the hospital was significantly larger than those in the patients who survived (12 mm compared with 9.9 mm, p = 0.004). Symptomatic unruptured aneurysms were significantly larger than incidental unruptured aneurysms (14.6 mm compared with 6.9 mm, p = 0.032), which were, in turn, larger than aneurysms that were unruptured and part of a multiple aneurysm constellation. Both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms were larger in male than in female patients, but not significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Site and patient age, as well as lesion size, may affect the chance of rupture.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms is controversial. Investigators from the International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms aimed to assess the natural history of unruptured intracranial aneurysms and to measure the risk associated with their repair. METHODS: Centres in the USA, Canada, and Europe enrolled patients for prospective assessment of unruptured aneurysms. Investigators recorded the natural history in patients who did not have surgery, and assessed morbidity and mortality associated with repair of unruptured aneurysms by either open surgery or endovascular procedures. FINDINGS: 4060 patients were assessed-1692 did not have aneurysmal repair, 1917 had open surgery, and 451 had endovascular procedures. 5-year cumulative rupture rates for patients who did not have a history of subarachnoid haemorrhage with aneurysms located in internal carotid artery, anterior communicating or anterior cerebral artery, or middle cerebral artery were 0\%, 2. 6\%, 14 5\%, and 40\% for aneurysms less than 7 mm, 7-12 mm, 13-24 mm, and 25 mm or greater, respectively, compared with rates of 2 5\%, 14 5\%, 18 4\%, and 50\%, respectively, for the same size categories involving posterior circulation and posterior communicating artery aneurysms. These rates were often equalled or exceeded by the risks associated with surgical or endovascular repair of comparable lesions. Patients' age was a strong predictor of surgical outcome, and the size and location of an aneurysm predict both surgical and endovascular outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Many factors are involved in management of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Site, size, and group specific risks of the natural history should be compared with site, size, and age-specific risks of repair for each patient.},

  abstract = {CSF pressure recordings have been taken from the lumbar region and the cisterna magna of 16 patients during coughing in the sitting position. Isolated coughs of low amplitude have been studied. The lumbar pressure waves occur sooner and lower. Thus there is a phase during which the lumbar pressure exceeds the cisternal, followed by one in which the cisternal exceeds the lumbar. These phenomena may be conveniently displayed on a differential trace. The phase during which the cisternal pressure exceeds the lumbar may be protracted. It is suggested that Froin's syndrome, central subarachnoid pouches and syringobulbia may be associated with upward pressure waves. Cough headache, the filling stages of communicating syringomyelia and tonsillar herniation may be associated with valve-like blockage at the foramen magnum which produces craniospinal pressure dissociation by interfering with downward or rebound pulsation. Decompensation of hydrocephalus after birth may be related to pulsation in association with crying; also after removal of a meningocele sac decompensation may be related to the effects of similar pulsation modified by changes in capacitance following operation. The cord destruction of syringomyelia, and the mechanisms which fill spinal subarachnoid cysts may be related to pressure waves directed both upwards and downwards. The merits and limitations of cough impulse as a clinical test for spinal blockage are discussed, and the suggestion is made that after further evaluation they may provide a more sensitive indication of spinal blockage than Queckenstedt's test.},

The particular clinical features related to hindbrain hernia are syringomyelia, cough headache, cough syncope, and lower cranial nerve signs with oscillopsia and cerebellar ataxia. Correction of the pressure dissociation is often associated with marked clinical improvement.

  abstract = {Fluid cavities extending beyond several segments within the spinal cord comprise a pathologic entity that is not a disease, but a condition with many possible causes. Hindbrain herniation with or without associated arachnoid thickening is the most common cause, followed by spinal arachnoiditis, especially with paraplegia and also intraspinal tumors. The presentation may be variable, particularly in the hindbrain-related cases, and the final clinical picture is convergent because the pattern of destruction of the cord is determined by planes of weaknesses. It is almost always a surgical condition. The destructive forces are those of fluid cutting into the tissues, and expeditious and careful surgery is often successful, particularly if practiced early. The surgery should be planned to deal with raised CSF pressure and hydrocephalus, then the likely filling mechanism. Suck, the development of pressure differences acting over several seconds and deforming parts of the neuraxis such as a HBH, may provide a filling mechanism. Slosh, the impulsive rapid movement of CSF within the syrinx, both upward and downward, provides a continuing destructive force and may also be partly responsible for filling. Drainage of the syrinx may be a useful supplementary procedure and is conveniently combined with operation on the nonhindbrain-related cases. Drainage in these cases should not usually be at the widest part of the syrinx, tempting though that may be, but should be combined, where possible, with an attempt to correct the filling mechanism present at the site of the pathology. The ideas in this article are simple, but the surgical management of the various problems is not easy. The syringomyelic cord is fragile, neurologic losses are likely to be permanent, as are orthopedic problems such as Charcot's joints and kyphoscoliosis. Future management problems will include cases in which HBH or syringomyelia comes to light as an unexpected finding on MRI. If neurologic deficits are allowed to develop, they are likely to be irreversible and permanently affect the patients.},

Only sporadic reports of conus AVMs have been published. OBJECTIVE: To better define the presentation, prognosis, and optimal treatment of these lesions, we present the first case series of conus AVMs, reflecting over 2 decades of experience with a multimodality endovascular and surgical approach. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 16 patients with a conus AVM evaluated at our institution from 1989 to 2010. For each patient, the following clinical data were collected: age, sex, symptoms, angiographic findings, type of treatment, complications, degree of angiographic obliteration, recurrence at follow-up, and need for re-treatment. Ambulatory status, Frankel Grade, motor function, and bladder/bowel function were assessed before treatment, at discharge, and at last follow-up. RESULTS: All 16 patients were treated. Eight (50\%) patients underwent embolization followed by microsurgical resection, and 8 (50\%) underwent microsurgical resection only. The rate of complete angiographic obliteration was 88\%. At last follow-up (mean, 70 months), 43\% of patients neurologically improved, 43\% were stable, and 14\% worsened in comparison with before treatment. During follow-up, 3 recurrences were detected, including the only 2 instances of long-term neurological decline. In the absence of recurrence, all patients ambulatory before treatment remained ambulatory at follow-up, whereas 75\% of the initially nonambulatory patients regained the ability to walk. CONCLUSION: Although conus AVMs are challenging to treat, excellent long-term outcomes are possible with a multimodality approach. Recurrence is associated with long-term neurological decline and calls for close follow-up.},

To show this far laterally, the "window" on the CT scanner must be opened wider than usual. Both coronal and parasagittal views will demonstrate the condition, but the coronal is the most valuable. Symptoms are classical spinal nerve compression. Usually it is the L5/S1 level that is involved, but other levels can be. At surgery, it is most important that nerve decompression be carried far enough laterally. This can mean sacrificing the lower half of the pedicle and the entire transverse process. Part of the body of S1 and of the sacral ala can be removed if the surgeon prefers. Because so much bone is removed, instability is a factor to be seriously considered. How to decompress adequately and still maintain stability often poses a most difficult problem.},

The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic incidental aneurysms. METHODS: The authors studied all cerebral arteriography reports produced at a single institution, the University of Virginia, between April 1969 and January 1980. A review of 3684 arteriograms demonstrated 24 cases of asymptomatic aneurysms, yielding a prevalence rate of 0.65\%. The majority (67\%) of the 24 patients harboring unruptured aneurysms were women. More than 90\% of the unruptured aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation and in locations similar to those found in patients with ruptured aneurysms. Nearly 80\% of the aneurysms were smaller than 1 cm in their greatest diameter. The frequency of asymmetrical unruptured aneurysms (0.6-1.5\%) was constant throughout all relevant age ranges (35-84 years). CONCLUSIONS: While keeping in mind appropriate caveats in extrapolating from these data, the prevalence rate of asymptomatic unruptured aneurysms found in the present study allows an estimation of the yearly rate of rupture of these lesions. The authors suggest that this yearly rate of rupture falls within the range of 1 to 2\%.},

OBJECTIVES: To investigate alterations of spinal cord (SC) motion within cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) across the cervical spinal segments and its relation to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-flow, anatomic conditions, and clinical parameters. SETTING: University Hospital Balgrist, Zurich, Switzerland. METHODS: Overall, 12 patients suffering from CSM at level C5 and 12 controls underwent cardiac-gated 2D phase-contrast-MRI at level C2 and C5 and standard MRI sequences. Parameters of interest: Velocity measurements of SC and CSF (area under the curve\,=\,total displacement (normalization for duration of the heart cycle), total displacement ratio (C5/C2; intraindividual normalization for confounders)), spinal canal diameters, clinical motor- and sensory scores, and performance measures. RESULTS: Interrater reliability was excellent for SC motion at both levels and for CSF flow at C2, but not reliable for CSF flow at C5. Within controls, SC motion at C2 positively correlated with SC motion at C5 (p\,=\,0.000); this correlation diminished in patients (p\,=\,0.860). SC total displacement ratio was significantly increased in patients (p\,=\,0.029) and correlated with clinical impairment (p\,=\,0.017). Morphometric measures of the extent of stenosis were not related to SC motion or clinical symptoms. CONCLUSION: The findings revealed physiological interactions of CSF flow and SC motion across the cervical spine in healthy controls while being diminished in CSM patients. Findings of focally increased SC motion at the level of stenosis were related to clinical impairment and might be promising as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in CSM.

METHODS: Nine healthy volunteers and eight patients with Chiari I malformations were examined with phase-contrast cine MR. With a region-of-interest cursor, the directions and intensities of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid were assessed and intensity-versus-time graphs generated. RESULTS: Cerebrospinal fluid flow patterns of the patients with Chiari I malformations were normal except for absence of valleculla flow. In addition, increased velocities (10 times normal) of the tonsils of all patients with Chiari I malformations together with posterior movement of the medulla (rather than the expected anterior movement seen in volunteers) occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Increased velocities of the tonsils may be the result of the carotid systolic pulse being delivered to a structure (the tonsil) without the normal surrounding cerebrospinal fluid, resulting in impact of the tonsils in the confined foramen magnum and a consequent caudocranial recoil. An alternative explanation would include the Bernoulli effect caused by the confined location of the tonsils. There may be a decrease in the peak tonsillar velocities after surgery.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review of published prevalence of adjacent segment degeneration (ASD) after spine surgery. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of ASD in patients after cervical and lumbar spine surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: ASD is a common complication after spine surgery in long-term follow-up. A large body of literature has been reported on the topic, but no meta-analysis of the epidemiological data on ASD has been published METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE until March 2012 published in English language that reported the prevalence of ASD after spine surgery. We determined the ASD rates by calculating proportions and 95\% confidence interval (CI) for each study and then pooled the data to derive a pooled proportion and 95\% CI. RESULTS: A total of 94 studies with 34,716 patients from 19 countries were included. The occurrence of radiograph ASD ranged from 4.8\% to 92.2\%, and the pooled prevalence was 29.3\% (95\% CI, 22.7\%-35.8\%) by the random-effects model. The occurrence of symptoms ASD ranged from 0.0\% to 30.3\%, and the pooled prevalence was 7.4\% (95\% CI, 6.4\%-8.5\%). In cervical position, the occurrence of radiograph ASD and symptoms ASD was 32.8\% (95\% CI, 17.8\%-47.9\%) and 6.3\% (95\% CI, 4.8\%-7.8\%); in lumbar position, the occurrence of radiograph ASD and symptoms ASD was 26.6\% (95\% CI, 21.3\%-31.9\%) and 8.5\% (95\% CI, 6.4\%-10.7\%). In the 0.5- to 2- or less, more than 2- to 5- or less, and more than 5- to 20- or less year diagnosis time, the radiograph ASD prevalence was 21.8\% (16.0\%-27.6\%), 33.6\% (21.8\%-45.4\%), and 37.4\% (10.7\%-64.1\%), respectively; and the symptoms ASD prevalence was 6.5\% (4.8\%-8.1\%), 12.1\% (8.2\%-16.0\%), and 3.2\% (2.5\%-4.0\%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Spine surgery is associated with significant risk of ASD. These figures may be useful in the estimation of the burden of the ASD after spine surgery.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Appreciation of the optimal management of skeletally mature patients with spinal deformities requires understanding of the natural history of the disease relative to expected outcomes of surgical intervention. Appropriate outcome measures are necessary to define the surgical treatment. Unfortunately, the literature lacks prospective randomized data. The majority of published series report outcomes of a particular surgical approach, procedure, or surgeon. The purpose of the current study was to systematically review the present spine deformity literature and assess the available data on clinical and radiographic outcome measurements. METHODS: A systematic review of MEDLINE and PubMed databases was performed to identify articles published from 1950 to the present using the following key words: "adult scoliosis surgery," "adult spine deformity surgery," "outcomes," and "complications." Exclusion criteria included follow-up shorter than 2 years and mean patient age younger than 18 years. Data on major curve (coronal scoliosis or lumbar lordosis Cobb angle as reported), major curve correction, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) instrument scores, complications, and pseudarthroses were recorded. RESULTS: Forty-nine articles were obtained and included in this review; 3299 patient data points were analyzed. The mean age was 47.7 years, and the mean follow-up period was 3.6 years. The average major curve correction was 26.6 degrees (for 2188 patients); for 2129 patients, it was possible to calculate average curve reduction as a percentage (40.7\%). The mean total ODI was 41.2 (for 1289 patients), and the mean postoperative reduction in ODI was 15.7 (for 911 patients). The mean SRS-30 equivalent score was 97.1 (for 1700 patients) with a mean postoperative decrease of 23.1 (for 999 patients). There were 897 reported complications for 2175 patients (41.2\%) and 319 pseudarthroses for 2469 patients (12.9\%). CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for adult scoliosis is associated with improvement in radiographic and clinical outcomes at a minimum 2-year follow-up. Perioperative morbidity includes an approximately 13\% risk of pseudarthrosis and a greater than 40\% incidence of perioperative adverse events. Incidence of perioperative complications is substantial and must be considered when deciding optimal disease management. Although the quality of published studies in this area has improved, particularly in the last few years, the current review highlights the lack of routine use of standardized outcomes measures and assessment in the adult scoliosis literature.},

Phase-contrast can quantitatively measure stroke volume in selected regions, notably the aqueduct of Sylvius, synchronized to the heartbeat. Judicious fine-tuning of the technique is needed to achieve maximal temporal resolution, and it has limited visualization of CSF motion in many CNS regions. Phase-contrast is frequently used to evaluate those patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus and a Chiari I malformation. Correlation with successful treatment outcome has been problematic. Time-spatial labeling inversion pulse, with a high signal-to-noise ratio, assesses linear and turbulent motion of CSF anywhere in the CNS. Time-spatial labeling inversion pulse can qualitatively visualize whether CSF flows between 2 compartments and determine whether there is flow through the aqueduct of Sylvius or a new surgically created stoma. Cine images reveal CSF linear and turbulent flow patterns.},

The subjects included 158 autopsy cases ranging in age from 1 week postnatally to 116 years of age. Each segment of the whole spinal cords was investigated from the C3 to S3 levels. The microscopic pictures of the central canal were classified as patent or occluded at each level for each age decade. The patency rate under 1 year of age was 100\% in almost all the segments, which markedly decreased in the second decade, and the canals were occluded in all the segments with advancing age. According to the longitudinal pattern of the central canal occlusion, 19 of 20 cases where the canals were patent in all segment levels were less than 10 years of age. Cases in which the canals were occluded in all segment levels appeared in the second decade, and their number increased gradually with advancing age. The occlusion of the central canal started at the T6 and L5 to S2 levels. We suggest that the central canal does not function after infancy because of its occlusion, and that it is not involved in the development of syringomyelia in adult patients.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: A correlation mapping technique delineating delay time and maximum correlation for characterizing pulsatile cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) propagation was proposed. After proofing its technical concept, this technique was applied to healthy volunteers and idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) patients. METHODS: A time-resolved three dimensional-phase contrast (3D-PC) sampled the cardiac-driven CSF velocity at 32 temporal points per cardiac period at each spatial location using retrospective cardiac gating. The proposed technique visualized distributions of propagation delay and correlation coefficient of the PC-based CSF velocity waveform with reference to a waveform at a particular point in the CSF space. The delay time was obtained as the amount of time-shift, giving the maximum correlation for the velocity waveform at an arbitrary location with that at the reference location. The validity and accuracy of the technique were confirmed in a flow phantom equipped with a cardiovascular pump. The technique was then applied to evaluate the intracranial CSF motions in young, healthy (N = 13), and elderly, healthy (N = 13) volunteers and iNPH patients (N = 13). RESULTS: The phantom study demonstrated that root mean square error of the delay time was 2.27\%, which was less than the temporal resolution of PC measurement used in this study (3.13\% of a cardiac cycle). The human studies showed a significant difference (P {$<$} 0.01) in the mean correlation coefficient between the young, healthy group and the other two groups. A significant difference (P {$<$} 0.05) was also recognized in standard deviation of the correlation coefficients in intracranial CSF space among all groups. The result suggests that the CSF space compliance of iNPH patients was lower than that of healthy volunteers. CONCLUSION: The correlation mapping technique allowed us to visualize pulsatile CSF velocity wave propagations as still images. The technique may help to classify diseases related to CSF dynamics, such as iNPH.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The development of syringomyelia has been associated with changes in CSF flow dynamics in the spinal subarachnoid space. However, differences in CSF flow velocity between patients with posttraumatic syringomyelia and healthy participants remains unclear. The aim of this work was to define differences in CSF flow above and below a syrinx in participants with posttraumatic syringomyelia and compare the CSF flow with that in healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six participants with posttraumatic syringomyelia were recruited for this study. Phase-contrast MR imaging was used to measure CSF flow velocity at the base of the skull and above and below the syrinx. Velocity magnitudes and temporal features of the CSF velocity profile were compared with those in healthy controls. RESULTS: CSF flow velocity in the spinal subarachnoid space of participants with syringomyelia was similar at different locations despite differences in syrinx size and locations. Peak cranial and caudal velocities above and below the syrinx were not significantly different (peak cranial velocity, P = .9; peak caudal velocity, P = 1.0), but the peak velocities were significantly lower (P {$<$} .001, P = .007) in the participants with syringomyelia compared with matched controls. Most notably, the duration of caudal flow was significantly shorter (P = .003) in the participants with syringomyelia. CONCLUSIONS: CSF flow within the posttraumatic syringomyelia group was relatively uniform along the spinal canal, but there are differences in the timing of CSF flow compared with that in matched healthy controls. This finding supports the hypothesis that syrinx development may be associated with temporal changes in spinal CSF flow.},

The CFD simulations considered the geometry to be rigid-walled and did not include small anatomical structures such as nerve roots, denticulate ligaments and arachnoid trabeculae. Results were compared at nine axial planes along the cervical SSS in terms of peak CSF velocities in both the cranial and caudal direction and visual interpretation of thru-plane velocity profiles. 4D PC MRI peak CSF velocities were consistently greater than the CFD peak velocities and these differences were more pronounced in CM patients than in healthy subjects. In the upper cervical SSS of CM patients the 4D PC MRI quantified stronger fluid jets than the CFD. Visual interpretation of the 4D PC MRI thru-plane velocity profiles showed greater pulsatile movement of CSF in the anterior SSS in comparison to the posterior and reduction in local CSF velocities near nerve roots. CFD velocity profiles were relatively uniform around the spinal cord for all subjects. This study represents the first comparison of 4D PC MRI measurements to CFD of CSF flow in the cervical SSS. The results highlight the utility of 4D PC MRI for evaluation of complex CSF dynamics and the need for improvement of CFD methodology. Future studies are needed to investigate whether integration of fine anatomical structures and gross motion of the brain and/or spinal cord into the computational model will lead to a better agreement between the two techniques.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To validate a real-time phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (RT-PCMRI) sequence in a controlled phantom model, and to quantify the relative contributions of respiration and cardiac pulsations on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) velocity at the level of the foramen magnum (FM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: To validate the 3T MRI techniques, in vitro studies used a realistic model of the spinal subarachnoid space driven by pulsatile flow waveforms mimicking the respiratory and cardiac components of CSF flow. Subsequently, CSF flow was measured continuously during 1-minute RT-PCMRI acquisitions at the FM while healthy subjects (N\,=\,20) performed natural breathing, deep breathing, breath-holding, and coughing. Conventional cardiac-gated PCMRI was obtained for comparison. A frequency domain power ratio analysis determined the relative contribution of respiration versus cardiac ([r/c]) components of CSF velocity. RESULTS: In vitro studies demonstrating the accuracy of RT-PCMRI within 5\% of input values showed that conventional PCMRI measures only the cardiac component of CSF velocity (0.42\,{$\pm$}\,0.02\,cm/s), averages out respiratory effects, and underestimates the magnitude of CSF velocity (0.96\,{$\pm$}\,0.07\,cm/s). In vivo RT-PCMRI measurements indicated the ratio of respiratory to cardiac velocity pulsations averaged over all subjects as [r/c\,=\,0.14\,{$\pm$}\,0.27] and [r/c\,=\,0.40\,{$\pm$}\,0.47] for natural and deep breathing, respectively. During coughing, the peak CSF velocity increased by a factor of 2.27\,{$\pm$}\,1.40. CONCLUSION: RT-PCMRI can noninvasively measure instantaneous CSF velocity driven by cardiac pulsations, respiration, and coughing in real time. A comparable contribution of respiration and cardiac pulsations on CSF velocity was found during deep breathing but not during natural breathing. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 1 J.

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness and safety of cervical laminoplasty versus laminectomy and fusion for the treatment of cervical myelopathy, and to identify any patient subgroups for whom one treatment may result in better outcomes than the other. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Cervical laminoplasty and cervical laminectomy plus fusion are both procedures that treat cervical stenosis induced myelopathy by expanding the space available for the spinal cord. Although there are strong proponents of each procedure, the effectiveness, safety, and differential effectiveness and safety of laminoplasty versus laminectomy and fusion remains unclear. METHODS: A systematic search of multiple major medical reference databases was conducted to identify studies that compared laminoplasty with laminectomy and fusion. Studies could include either or both cervical myelopathic spondylosis (CSM) and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies were included. Case reports and studies with less than 10 patients in the comparative group were excluded. Japanese Orthopaedic Association, modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association, and Nurick scores were the primary outcomes measuring myelopathy effectiveness. Reoperation and complication rates were evaluated for safety. Clinical recommendations were made through a modified Delphi approach by applying the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation/Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality criteria. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 305 citations, and 4 retrospective cohort studies ultimately met our inclusion criteria. For patients with CSM, data from 3 class of evidence III retrospective cohort studies suggest that there is no difference between treatment groups in severity of myelopathy or pain: 2 studies reported no significant difference between treatment groups in severity of myelopathy, and 3 studies found no significant difference in pain outcomes between treatment groups. For patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, one small class of evidence III retrospective cohort study reported significant improvements in myelopathy severity after laminectomy and fusion compared with laminoplasty, but no differences in long-term pain between treatment groups. The overall evidence on the comparative safety of laminoplasty compared with laminectomy and fusion is inconsistent. Reoperation rates were lower after laminoplasty in 2 of 3 studies reporting. However, the incidence of debilitating neck pain was higher after laminoplasty as reported by one study; results on neurological complications were inconclusive, with 2 studies reporting. Results on kyphotic deformity were inconsistent, with opposite results in the 2 studies reporting. After laminectomy and fusion, 1\% to 38\% of patients had pseudarthrosis. Infection rates were slightly lower after laminoplasty, but the results are not likely to be statistically significant. CONCLUSION: For patients with CSM, there is low-quality evidence that suggests that laminoplasty and laminectomy and fusion procedures are similarly effective in treating CSM. For patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, the evidence regarding the effectiveness of these procedures is insufficient. For both patient populations, the evidence as to whether one procedure is safer than the other is insufficient. Higher-quality research is necessary to more clearly delineate when one procedure is preferred compared with the other. EVIDENCE-BASED CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: RECOMMENDATION: For CSM, evidence suggests that laminoplasty and laminectomy-fusion procedures can be similarly effective. We suggest that surgeons consider each case individually and take into account their own familiarity and expertise with each procedure. OVERALL STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE: Low. STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATION: Weak.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine sex differences and age-related correlations of CCG and relationships between CCG and other spinopelvic parameters/health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Few studies have investigated CCG in a relatively large sample of elderly asymptomatic individuals. METHODS: Six hundred seventy-one healthy participants older than 50 years (mean age, 72.9 yr; range, 50-92 yr) were enrolled. Whole-spine standing radiographs were obtained. The following radiographical measurements were obtained: (1) CCG-C7 SVA, (2) C7-SVA, (3) CCG-SVA, (4) C2-C7 lordosis angle, (5) thoracic kyphosis, (6) lumbar lordosis, (7) pelvic incidence, and (8) sacral slope. HRQOL measures included the EuroQol-5D and Oswestry Disability Index. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were calculated between pairs of radiographical measures and HRQOL. RESULTS: Sex differences were observed in CCG-C7 SVA, CCG-SVA, C2-C7 Cobb angle, thoracic kyphosis, and pelvic incidence. Three SVA parameters (CCG-C7 SVA, C7-SVA, CCG-SVA) rapidly increased between seventh and ninth decades and were approximately 40, 80, and 120 mm, respectively, in the ninth decade. Age-related correlations were observed for all parameters without pelvic incidence, and the CCG measurement correlated the most with age. Furthermore, CCG-SVA correlated with other spinopelvic measurements and HRQOL. CONCLUSION: Age-related changes and sex difference in craniopelvic alignment were analyzed. Craniopelvic alignment became rapidly positive with age, particularly in the eighth decade. The CCG measurement correlated the most with age and may be a useful index marker of global spinal balance in decision making for surgical treatment of adult deformity involving cervical and thoracolumbar lesions.

Recent Findings{$\quad$}With more than 11 million baby boomers joining the population of over 60 years of age in the United States, the incidence of lumbar deformity is greatly increasing. Recent literature suggests that a lack of evidence exists to support the effectiveness of nonoperative treatment for adult scoliosis. In regards to operative treatment, current literature reports a varying range of improved clinical outcomes, curve correction, and complication rates. The extension of fusion to S1 compared with L5 and lower thoracic levels compared with L1 remains a highly controversial topic among literature. Summary{$\quad$}Most adult deformity patients never seek nonoperative or operative treatment. Of the few that seek treatment, many can benefit from nonoperative treatment. However, in selected patients who have failed nonoperative treatment and who are candidates for surgical intervention, the literature reflects positive outcomes related to surgical intervention as compared with nonoperative treatment despite varying associated ranges in morbidity and mortality rates. If nonoperative therapy fails in addressing a patient's complaints, then an appropriate surgical procedure that relieves neural compression, corrects excessive sagittal or coronal imbalance, and results in a solidly fused, pain-free spine is warranted.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The natural course of syringomyelia is unpredictable. Only a few cases of adults with spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia associated with Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) have been reported. The timing of surgical intervention for syringomyelia remains controversial. The present report has documented a case with the longest medical history of syringomyelia reported, the associated imaging findings over 16 years, the mild symptom progression after the spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia, and a review of the relevant reported data. The natural history of our patient provides a unique view regarding the factors that might lead to the development and spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 36-year-old woman who had been monitored for 16 years for mild symptomatic CM-I and syringomyelia. After regular follow-up examinations for the initial 10 years, magnetic resonance imaging revealed partial spontaneous resolution of the syringomyelia and unchanged symptoms. However, after 6 additional years of follow-up examinations, her symptoms had mildly progressed, and the size of the syringomyelia had obviously decreased. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from our patient suggest that the natural course of mild symptomatic CM-I in adult patients will be benign and nonprogressive. Patients will commonly present with very few or mild symptoms, despite the presence of a large syrinx. It would be reasonable to observe patients with similar mild symptoms and syringomyelia. Surgery will be indicated by the type, severity, and duration of symptoms at the first clinical visit. Periodic follow-up examinations are also essential after spontaneous resolution because the pathophysiology of syringomyelia is incompletely understood and recurrence possible.},

  abstract = {Damage to the corticospinal tract is a leading cause of motor disability, for example in stroke or spinal cord injury. Some function usually recovers, but whether plasticity of undamaged ipsilaterally descending corticospinal axons and/or brainstem pathways such as the reticulospinal tract contributes to recovery is unknown. Here, we examined the connectivity in these pathways to motor neurons after recovery from corticospinal lesions. Extensive unilateral lesions of the medullary corticospinal fibres in the pyramidal tract were made in three adult macaque monkeys. After an initial contralateral flaccid paralysis, motor function rapidly recovered, after which all animals were capable of climbing and supporting their weight by gripping the cage bars with the contralesional hand. In one animal where experimental testing was carried out, there was (as expected) no recovery of fine independent finger movements. Around 6 months post-lesion, intracellular recordings were made from 167 motor neurons innervating hand and forearm muscles. Synaptic responses evoked by stimulating the unlesioned ipsilateral pyramidal tract and the medial longitudinal fasciculus were recorded and compared with control responses in 207 motor neurons from six unlesioned animals. Input from the ipsilateral pyramidal tract was rare and weak in both lesioned and control animals, suggesting a limited role for this pathway in functional recovery. In contrast, mono- and disynaptic excitatory post-synaptic potentials elicited from the medial longitudinal fasciculus significantly increased in average size after recovery, but only in motor neurons innervating forearm flexor and intrinsic hand muscles, not in forearm extensor motor neurons. We conclude that reticulospinal systems sub-serve some of the functional recovery after corticospinal lesions. The imbalanced strengthening of connections to flexor, but not extensor, motor neurons mirrors the extensor weakness and flexor spasm which in neurological experience is a common limitation to recovery in stroke survivors.},

RESULTS: a cerebrospinal fluid collection was identified in the ventral cervical spinal cord causing mass effect associated with cord atrophy and there were signs of spontaneous intracranial hypotension on the MRI brain including subdural cere-brospinal fluid collections, meningeal enhancement and slumped posterior fossa. CONCLUSIONS: this is the first description of a spontaneous spinal fluid collection causing direct compression and cord sig-nal change, manifest as a motor deficit, with intracranial signs of spontaneous hypotension.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1996 to 2015, IFNSs closely adherent to the facial nerve without intratemporal involvement were selected for this study. IFNSs were subdivided into an intracapsular microenucleation group and a resection with reconstruction group. Facial nerve function was assessed using the House-Brackmann Grading system. The study sample consisted of 28 patients who were followed up for 5.75 years (range, 1-15 years). RESULTS: Of the 28 patients, 18 IFNSs were from the main trunk. Radical intracapsular microenucleation was performed in 9 patients, resection with reconstruction in 7 patients, and only biopsy in 2 patients. Nine patients who received intracapsular microenucleation recovered to House-Brackmann Grade I (55.6\%) or Grade II (44.4\%), in comparison to the 7 patients from resection group (Grade III, 28.6\%; Grade IV, 42.9\%; Grade V, 28.6\%). The other 10 IFNSs from the distal branches maintained favorable nerve function with either of the treatments. Tumor recurrence was not observed except for the two patients with only biopsy. CONCLUSION: Radical intracapsular microenucleation with nerve preservation was a safe and reliable treatment for IFNS, especially for the IFNS from the main trunk.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dumbbell-shaped trigeminal neurinomas are rare benign tumors with a controversy regarding their treatment and surgical approaches. We conducted an investigation on elucidating a strategy for the treatment of DSTNs. METHODS: One hundred thirty-seven patients with trigeminal neurinomas, accounting for 0.6\% of all intracranial tumors and 3.8\% of intracranial neurinomas, were screened out from the data bank on brain tumors in Hua Shan Hospital (Shanghai, China) from 1978 to 2003. Among them, 57 patients with DSTNs were found without Recklinghausen disease and analyzed retrospectively. Patients were divided into 2 groups. In the early group (1978-1984), a series of conventional intradural approaches were used, and in the latter group (1985-2003), an extradurotransdurotranstrigeminal pore approach with orbitozygomatic craniotomy was applied. After the tumor in the middle cranial fossa was resected, the tumor in the posterior fossa was resected via a suboccipital approach in the early group and through enlarged porus trigeminus without resection of the petrous apex in the latter group. RESULTS: There were 12 patients in the early group and 45 patients (including 6 patients with recurrent tumors) in the latter group. The mean age was 37 years (range, 14-56 years) and 39 years (range, 12-72 years), respectively, in the early and latter groups. There was no predominance in sex in the 2 groups. The mean duration of clinical manifestations before admission were 2.2 and 2 years, respectively, in the early and latter groups. Tumor size measured on MRI and/or CT were 30 to 40 mm in 4 (33\%) cases from the early group and 14 (31\%) cases from the latter group, 41 to 50 mm in 8 (67\%) cases from the early group and 25 (56\%) cases from the latter group, and more than 50 mm in 6 (13\%) cases from the latter group. There were 3 patients in the latter group with a tumor extending into the infratemporal fossa and pterygopalatine fossa. Total tumor resection was achieved in 42\% (5/12) of the early group and 87\% (39/45) of the latter group (chi(2) = 10.897, P {$<$} .001); incomplete tumor removal was done in 58\% (7/12) of the early group and 13\% (6/45) of the latter group. One patient in the early group died of brainstem injury postoperatively. There was no surgical mortality in the latter group. Cranial nerve morbidities were seen in 80\% of the early group and 41\% of the latter group (chi(2) = 12.052, P {$<$} .01), when patients were discharged. Six months after operation, however, cranial nerve morbidities were seen in 55\% of the early group and 18.6\% of the latter group (chi(2) = 8.585, P {$<$} .01). A long-term follow-up study was available in 41 (75\%) patients, with a period of 2 to 20 years (mean, 10 years). Karnofsky prognosis scale scores were at least 90 in 60\% of the early group and 77\% of the latter group and 70 to 80 in 40\% of the early group and 23\% of the latter group. Recurrent tumors occurred in 3 patients from the early group and were reoperated on. One patient with a recurrent tumor from the latter group underwent radiosurgery 5 years after the operation. CONCLUSION: The best treatment for large or giant DSTNs is microsurgery with extradurotransdurotranstrigeminal pore approach via single-stage skull-base craniotomy. It is not necessary to resect the petrous apex for removal of the tumor in the posterior fossa. Radiosurgery can be used for the residual or recurrent tumors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transverse sinus stenosis (TSS) is common among patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. No previous studies have reported on double-track sign detected on axial Gd-enhanced T1WI in TSS. This study aimed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the double-track sign in the detection of TSS. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 383 patients with transverse sinus thrombosis (TST) and 30 patients with normal transverse sinus from 5 participating hospitals in china from January 2008 to June 2014. 167 feasible transverse sinuses included in this study were categorized into TSS (n = 76), transverse sinus occlusion (TSO) (n = 52) and transverse sinus normal (TSN) groups (n = 39) according to imaging diagnosis on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) or magnetic resonance venography (MRV). Double-track sign on axial Gd-enhanced T1WI was compared among the three groups. Sensitivity and specificity of double-track sign in detection of TSS were calculated, with final imaging diagnosis of TSS on DSA or MRV as the reference standard. RESULTS: Of 383 patients with TST recruited over a 6.5-year period, 128 patients were enrolled in the study, 255 patients were excluded because of insufficient clinical data, imaging finding and delay time, and 30 matched patients with normal transverse sinus were enrolled in the control group. Therefore, double-track sign assessment was conducted in 167 available transverse sinuses of 158 patients. Of the 76 sinuses in TSS group, 51 had double-track sign. Of the other 91 sinuses in TSO and TSN groups, 3 had a false-positive double-track sign. Thus, double-track sign on axial Gd-enhanced T1WI was 67.1\% (95\% CI 55.3-77.2) sensitive and 96.7\% (95\% CI 89.9-99.1) specific for detection of TSS. CONCLUSIONS: The double-track sign on axial Gd-enhanced T1WI is highly specific and moderate sensitive for detection of TSS. Nevertheless, it could be a direct sign and might provide an early clue for TSS.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate whether pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar multifidus muscle (LMM) would predict clinical outcomes following lumbar spinal decompression for symptomatic spinal stenosis. METHODS: A prospective cohort of patients with symptomatic neurogenic claudication, documented spinal stenosis on pre-operative MRI underwent spinal decompression. All subjects completed standardised outcome measures (Core Outcome Measures Index (COMI), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI v2.1) pre-operatively, 1 and 2~years post-surgery. Surgery was performed using a standardised lumbar spinous process osteotomy for access, followed by a decompression of the central canal, lateral recess and foraminal zones as indicated by the pre-operative MRI. Lumbar MRI scans were evaluated by two independent observers who assessed the axial CSA of the LMM bilaterally and the degree of muscle atrophy according to the Kader classification (2000). Changes in COMI and ODI scores at 1 and 2~years were investigated for statistically significant correlations with CSA of LMM and Kader grading. Statistical analyses utilised Student's t test, kappa coefficient for inter-observer agreement and Bland-Altman Limits of Agreement (BALOA). RESULTS: 66 patients (41 female) aged between 29 and 86~years underwent single-level decompression in 44, two-level decompression in 16 and three-level decompression in 6 cases. No significant correlation was observed between improvements in ODI and COMI relative to age, degree of stenosis, posterior fat thickness or psoas CSA. Those subjects with the greatest LMM atrophy relative to psoas CSA and L5 vertebral body area on pre-operative MRI had the least absolute improvement in both ODI and COMI scores (p~=~0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced LMM CSA ({$<$}8.5~cm(2)) and muscle atrophy were associated with less favourable outcomes following lumbar spinal decompression. Pre-operative CSA of LMM appeared to be a more reliable predictor of post-operative clinical outcomes compared to the Kader Grading Score. This is the first study to investigate the prognostic value of pre-operative MRI appearance and CSA of LMM with respect to post-operative outcome following lumbar decompression surgery. Healthy pre-operative LMM is associated with better outcomes following lumbar spinal decompression.},
